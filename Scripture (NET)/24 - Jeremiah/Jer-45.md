Baruch is Rebuked but also Comforted ###### 1 The prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah while he was writing down in a scroll the words that Jeremiah spoke to him. (This happened in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah.) ###### v2 Jeremiah said, "The LORD God of Israel has a message for you, Baruch. ###### v3 'You have said, "I feel so hopeless! For the LORD has added sorrow to my suffering. I am worn out from groaning. I can't find any rest."'" ###### v4 The LORD told Jeremiah, "Tell Baruch, 'The LORD says, "I am about to tear down what I have built and to uproot what I have planted. I will do this throughout the whole earth. ###### v5 Are you looking for great things for yourself? Do not look for such things. For I, the LORD, affirm that I am about to bring disaster on all humanity. But I will allow you to escape with your life wherever you go."'"
