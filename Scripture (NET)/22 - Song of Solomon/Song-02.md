The Lily among the Thorns and the Apple Tree in the Forest ###### 1 I am a meadow flower from Sharon, a lily from the valleys. ###### v2 Like a lily among the thorns, so is my darling among the maidens. ###### v3 Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.The Banquet Hall for the Lovesick ###### v4 He brought me into the banquet hall, and he looked at me lovingly. ###### v5 Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am faint with love.The Double Refrain: Embracing and Adjuration ###### v6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me. ###### v7 I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and by the young does of the open fields: Do not awaken or arouse love until it pleases!The Arrival of the Lover ###### v8 Listen! My lover is approaching! Look! Here he comes, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills! ###### v9 My lover is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the window, peering through the lattice.The Season of Love and the Song of the Turtledove ###### v10 My lover spoke to me, saying: "Arise, my darling; My beautiful one, come away with me! ###### v11 Look! The winter has passed, the winter rains are over and gone. ###### v12 Blossoms have appeared in the land, the time for pruning and singing has come; the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. ###### v13 The fig tree has ripened its figs, the vines have blossomed and give off their fragrance. Arise, come away my darling; my beautiful one, come away with me!"The Dove in the Clefts of En Gedi ###### v14 O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the mountain crags, let me see your face, let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.The Foxes in the Vineyard ###### v15 Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes, that ruin the vineyards-- for our vineyard is in bloom.Poetic Refrain: Mutual Possession ###### v16 My lover is mine and I am his; he grazes among the lilies.The Gazelle and the Rugged Mountains ###### v17 Until the dawn arrives and the shadows flee, turn, my beloved-- be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountain gorges.
