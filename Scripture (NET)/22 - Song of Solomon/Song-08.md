The Beloved's Wish Song ###### 1 Oh, how I wish you were my little brother, nursing at my mother's breasts; if I saw you outside, I could kiss you-- surely no one would despise me! ###### v2 I would lead you and bring you to my mother's house, the one who taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.Double Refrain: Embracing and Adjuration ###### v3 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me. ###### v4 I admonish you, O maidens of Jerusalem: "Do not arouse or awaken love until it pleases!"The Awakening of Love ###### v5 Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? Under the apple tree I aroused you; there your mother conceived you, there she who bore you was in labor of childbirth.The Nature of True Love ###### v6 Set me like a cylinder seal over your heart, like a signet on your arm. For love is as strong as death, passion is as unrelenting as Sheol. Its flames burst forth, it is a blazing flame. ###### v7 Surging waters cannot quench love; floodwaters cannot overflow it. If someone were to offer all his possessions to buy love, the offer would be utterly despised.The Brother's Plan and the Sister's Reward ###### v8 We have a little sister, and as yet she has no breasts. What shall we do for our sister on the day when she is spoken for? ###### v9 If she is a wall, we will build on her a battlement of silver; but if she is a door, we will barricade her with boards of cedar. ###### v10 I was a wall, and my breasts were like fortress towers. Then I found favor in his eyes.Solomon's Vineyard and the Beloved's Vineyard ###### v11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon; he leased out the vineyard to those who maintained it. Each was to bring 1,000 shekels of silver for its fruit. ###### v12 My vineyard, which belongs to me, is at my disposal alone. The thousand shekels belong to you, O Solomon, and 200 shekels belong to those who maintain it for its fruit.Epilogue: The Lover's Request and His Beloved's Invitation ###### v13 O you who stay in the gardens, my companions are listening attentively for your voice; let me be the one to hear it! ###### v14 Make haste, my beloved! Be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
