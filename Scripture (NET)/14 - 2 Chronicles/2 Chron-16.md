###### v7 At that time Hanani the prophet visited King Asa of Judah and said to him: "Because you relied on the king of Syria and did not rely on the LORD your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped from your hand. ###### v8 Did not the Cushites and Libyans have a huge army with chariots and a very large number of horsemen? But when you relied on the LORD, he handed them over to you! ###### v9 Certainly the LORD watches the whole earth carefully and is ready to strengthen those who are devoted to him. You have acted foolishly in this matter; from now on you will have war." ###### v10 Asa was so angry at the prophet, he put him in jail. Asa also oppressed some of the people at that time.Asa's Reign Ends ###### v11 The events of Asa's reign, from start to finish, are recorded in the Scroll of the Kings of Judah and Israel. ###### v12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a foot disease and his disease became severe. Yet even in his disease, he did not seek the LORD, but only the doctors. ###### v13 Asa passed away in the forty-first year of his reign. ###### v14 He was buried in the tomb he had carved out in the City of David. They laid him to rest on a platform covered with spices and assorted mixtures of ointments. They made a huge bonfire to honor him.
