Jehoshaphat Becomes King ###### 1 His son Jehoshaphat replaced him as king and solidified his rule over Israel. ###### v2 He placed troops in all Judah's fortified cities and posted garrisons throughout the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had seized. ###### v3 The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed in his ancestor David's footsteps at the beginning of his reign. He did not seek the Baals, ###### v4 but instead sought the God of his ancestors and obeyed his commands, unlike the Israelites. ###### v5 The LORD made his kingdom secure; all Judah brought tribute to Jehoshaphat, and he became very wealthy and greatly respected. ###### v6 He was committed to following the LORD; he even removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah. ###### v7 In the third year of his reign he sent his officials Ben Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah. ###### v8 They were accompanied by the Levites Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah, and by the priests Elishama and Jehoram. ###### v9 They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the scroll of the law of the LORD. They traveled to all the cities of Judah and taught the people. ###### v10 The LORD put fear into all the kingdoms surrounding Judah; they did not make war with Jehoshaphat. ###### v11 Some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat tribute, including a load of silver. The Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks. ###### v12 Jehoshaphat's power kept increasing. He built fortresses and storage cities throughout Judah. ###### v13 He had many supplies stored in the cities of Judah and an army of skilled warriors stationed in Jerusalem. ###### v14 These were their divisions by families: There were 1,000 officers from Judah. Adnah the commander led 300,000 skilled warriors, ###### v15 Jehochanan the commander led 280,000, ###### v16 and Amasiah son of Zikri, who volunteered to serve the LORD, led 200,000 skilled warriors. ###### v17 From Benjamin, Eliada, a skilled warrior, led 200,000 men who were equipped with bows and shields, ###### v18 and Jehozabad led 180,000 trained warriors. ###### v19 These were the ones who served the king, besides those whom the king placed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.
