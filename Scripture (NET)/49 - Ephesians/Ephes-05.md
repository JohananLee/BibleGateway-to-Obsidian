Live in Love ###### 1 Therefore, be imitators of God as dearly loved children ###### v2 and live in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God. ###### v3 But among you there must not be either sexual immorality, impurity of any kind, or greed, as these are not fitting for the saints. ###### v4 Neither should there be vulgar speech, foolish talk, or coarse jesting--all of which are out of character--but rather thanksgiving. ###### v5 For you can be confident of this one thing: that no person who is immoral, impure, or greedy (such a person is an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.Live in the Light ###### v6 Let nobody deceive you with empty words, for because of these things God's wrath comes on the sons of disobedience. ###### v7 Therefore do not be sharers with them, ###### v8 for you were at one time darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live like children of light-- ###### v9 for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth-- ###### v10 trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. ###### v11 Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but rather expose them. ###### v12 For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention. ###### v13 But all things being exposed by the light are made visible. ###### v14 For everything made visible is light, and for this reason it says: "Awake, O sleeper! Rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you!"Live Wisely ###### v15 Therefore consider carefully how you live--not as unwise but as wise, ###### v16 taking advantage of every opportunity, because the days are evil. ###### v17 For this reason do not be foolish, but be wise by understanding what the Lord's will is. ###### v18 And do not get drunk with wine, which is debauchery, but be filled by the Spirit, ###### v19 speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord, ###### v20 always giving thanks to God the Father for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ###### v21 and submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.Exhortations to Households ###### v22 Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord, ###### v23 because the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church (he himself being the savior of the body). ###### v24 But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. ###### v25 Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her ###### v26 to sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of the water by the word, ###### v27 so that he may present the church to himself as glorious--not having a stain or wrinkle, or any such blemish, but holy and blameless. ###### v28 In the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. ###### v29 For no one has ever hated his own body, but he feeds it and takes care of it, just as Christ also does the church, ###### v30 because we are members of his body. ###### v31 **_For_** **_this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become_** **_one flesh._** ###### v32 This mystery is great--but I am actually speaking with reference to Christ and the church. ###### v33 Nevertheless, each one of you must also love his own wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
