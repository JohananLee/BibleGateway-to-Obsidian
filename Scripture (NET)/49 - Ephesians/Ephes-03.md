Paul's Relationship to the Divine Mystery ###### 1 For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles ###### v2 if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you, ###### v3 that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, as I wrote before briefly. ###### v4 When reading this, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ ###### v5 (which was not disclosed to people in former generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit), ###### v6 namely, that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus. ###### v7 I became a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God's grace that was given to me by the exercise of his power. ###### v8 To me--less than the least of all the saints--this grace was given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ ###### v9 and to enlighten everyone about God's secret plan--the mystery that has been hidden for ages in God who has created all things. ###### v10 The purpose of this enlightenment is that through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God should now be disclosed to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms. ###### v11 This was according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord, ###### v12 in whom we have boldness and confident access to God by way of Christ's faithfulness. ###### v13 For this reason I ask you not to lose heart because of what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.Prayer for Strengthened Love ###### v14 For this reason I kneel before the Father, ###### v15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named. ###### v16 I pray that according to the wealth of his glory he will grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person, ###### v17 that Christ will dwell in your hearts through faith, so that, because you have been rooted and grounded in love, ###### v18 you will be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, ###### v19 and thus to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you will be filled up to all the fullness of God. ###### v20 Now to him who by the power that is working within us is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think, ###### v21 to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
