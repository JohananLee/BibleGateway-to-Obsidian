One was to proceed on the top of the wall southward toward the Dung Gate. ###### v32 Going after them were Hoshaiah, half the leaders of Judah, ###### v33 Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, ###### v34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, ###### v35 some of the priests with trumpets, Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, ###### v36 and his colleagues--Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani--with musical instruments of David the man of God. (Ezra the scribe led them.) ###### v37 They went over the Fountain Gate and continued directly up the steps of the City of David on the ascent to the wall. They passed the house of David and continued on to the Water Gate toward the east. ###### v38 The second choir was proceeding in the opposite direction. I followed them, along with half the people, on top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, ###### v39 over the Ephraim Gate, the Jeshanah Gate, the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel, and the Tower of the Hundred, to the Sheep Gate. They stopped at the Gate of the Guard. ###### v40 Then the two choirs that gave thanks took their stations in the temple of God. I did also, along with half the officials with me, ###### v41 and the priests--Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with their trumpets-- ###### v42 and also Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The choirs sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah. ###### v43 And on that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had given them great joy. The women and children also rejoiced. The rejoicing in Jerusalem could be heard from far away. ###### v44 On that day men were appointed over the storerooms for the contributions, firstfruits, and tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions prescribed by the law for the priests and the Levites, for the people of Judah took delight in the priests and Levites who were ministering. ###### v45 They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and his son Solomon. ###### v46 For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph, there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanks to God. ###### v47 So in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, all Israel was contributing the portions for the singers and gatekeepers, according to the daily need. They also set aside the portion for the Levites, and the Levites set aside the portion for the descendants of Aaron.
