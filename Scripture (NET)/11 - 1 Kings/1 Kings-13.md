###### v11 Now there was an old prophet living in Bethel. When his sons came home, they told him everything the prophet had done in Bethel that day. And they told their father all the words that he had spoken to the king. ###### v12 Their father asked them, "Which road did he take?" His sons showed him the road the prophet from Judah had taken. ###### v13 He then told his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." When they had saddled the donkey for him, he mounted it ###### v14 and took off after the prophet, whom he found sitting under an oak tree. He asked him, "Are you the prophet from Judah?" He answered, "Yes, I am." ###### v15 He then said to him, "Come home with me and eat something." ###### v16 But he replied, "I can't go back with you. I am not allowed to eat food or to drink water with you in this place. ###### v17 For an order came to me in the Lord's message, 'Eat no food. Drink no water there. And do not return by the way you came.'" ###### v18 Then the old prophet said, "I too am a prophet like you. And an angel has told me in a message from the LORD, 'Bring him back with you to your house so he can eat food and drink water.'" But he had lied to him. ###### v19 So the prophet went back with him. He ate food in his house and he drank water. ###### v20 While they were sitting at the table, the Lord's message came to the old prophet who had brought him back. ###### v21 So he cried out to the prophet who had come from Judah, "This is what the LORD has said, 'You have rebelled against the LORD's instruction and have not obeyed the command the LORD your God gave you. ###### v22 You went back. You ate food. And you drank water in the place of which he had said to you, "Eat no food. Drink no water." Therefore your corpse will not be buried in your ancestral tomb.'" ###### v23 So this is what happened after he had eaten food and drunk water. The old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. ###### v24 So the prophet from Judah travelled on. Then a lion attacked him on the road and killed him. There was his body lying on the road, with the donkey standing next to it, and the lion just standing there by the body. ###### v25 Then some men came passing by and saw the body lying in the road with the lion standing next to the body. They went and reported what they had seen in the city where the old prophet lived. ###### v26 When the old prophet who had invited him to his house heard the news, he said, "It is the prophet who rebelled against the LORD. The LORD delivered him over to the lion and it tore him up and killed him, in keeping with the Lord's message that he had spoken to him." ###### v27 He told his sons, "Saddle my donkey." So they saddled it. ###### v28 He went and found the body lying in the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it; the lion had neither eaten the body nor attacked the donkey. ###### v29 The old prophet picked up the prophet's body, put it on the donkey, and brought it back. The old prophet then entered the city to mourn him and to bury him. ###### v30 He put the body into his own tomb, and they mourned over him, saying, "Ah, my brother!" ###### v31 After he buried him, he said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the tomb where the prophet is buried; put my bones right beside his bones, ###### v32 because the message that he announced as the LORD's message against the altar in Bethel and against all the temples on the high places in the cities of the north will certainly be fulfilled."A Prophet Announces the End of Jeroboam's Dynasty ###### v33 After this happened, Jeroboam still did not change his evil ways; he continued to appoint common people as priests at the high places. Anyone who wanted the job he consecrated as a priest. ###### v34 This sin caused Jeroboam's dynasty to come to an end and to be destroyed from the face of the earth.
