Learning from Israel's Failures ###### 1 For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea, ###### v2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, ###### v3 and all ate the same spiritual food, ###### v4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they were all drinking from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. ###### v5 But God was not pleased with most of them, for they were cut down in the wilderness. ###### v6 These things happened as examples for us, so that we will not crave evil things as they did. ###### v7 So do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, "**_The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play_**." ###### v8 And let us not be immoral, as some of them were, and 23,000 died in a single day. ###### v9 And let us not put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by snakes. ###### v10 And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel. ###### v11 These things happened to them as examples and were written for our instruction, on whom the ends of the ages have come. ###### v12 So let the one who thinks he is standing be careful that he does not fall. ###### v13 No trial has overtaken you that is not faced by others. And God is faithful: He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear, but with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it.Avoid Idol Feasts ###### v14 So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. ###### v15 I am speaking to thoughtful people. Consider what I say. ###### v16 Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ? ###### v17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread. ###### v18 Look at the people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar? ###### v19 Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything? ###### v20 No, I mean that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons. ###### v21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. ###### v22 Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we really stronger than he is?Live to Glorify God ###### v23 "Everything is lawful," but not everything is beneficial. "Everything is lawful," but not everything builds others up. ###### v24 Do not seek your own good, but the good of the other person. ###### v25 Eat anything that is sold in the marketplace without questions of conscience, ###### v26 for _the earth and its abundance are the Lord's_. ###### v27 If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is served without asking questions of conscience. ###### v28 But if someone says to you, "This is from a sacrifice," do not eat, because of the one who told you and because of conscience-- ###### v29 I do not mean yours but the other person's. For why is my freedom being judged by another's conscience? ###### v30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for the food that I give thanks for? ###### v31 So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. ###### v32 Do not give offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God, ###### v33 just as I also try to please everyone in all things. I do not seek my own benefit, but the benefit of many, so that they may be saved.
