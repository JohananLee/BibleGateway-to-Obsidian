Spiritual Gifts ###### 1 With regard to spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. ###### v2 You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols, however you were led. ###### v3 So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus is cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit. ###### v4 Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. ###### v5 And there are different ministries, but the same Lord. ###### v6 And there are different results, but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. ###### v7 To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all. ###### v8 For one person is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit, ###### v9 to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, ###### v10 to another performance of miracles, to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. ###### v11 It is one and the same Spirit, distributing as he decides to each person, who produces all these things.Different Members in One Body ###### v12 For just as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body--though many--are one body, so too is Christ. ###### v13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether Jews or Greeks or slaves or free, we were all made to drink of the one Spirit. ###### v14 For in fact the body is not a single member, but many. ###### v15 If the foot says, "Since I am not a hand, I am not part of the body," it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. ###### v16 And if the ear says, "Since I am not an eye, I am not part of the body," it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. ###### v17 If the whole body were an eye, what part would do the hearing? If the whole were an ear, what part would exercise the sense of smell? ###### v18 But as a matter of fact, God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided. ###### v19 If they were all the same member, where would the body be? ###### v20 So now there are many members, but one body. ###### v21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I do not need you," nor in turn can the head say to the foot, "I do not need you." ###### v22 On the contrary, those members that seem to be weaker are essential, ###### v23 and those members we consider less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our unpresentable members are clothed with dignity, ###### v24 but our presentable members do not need this. Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member, ###### v25 so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another. ###### v26 If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a member is honored, all rejoice with it. ###### v27 Now you are Christ's body, and each of you is a member of it. ###### v28 And God has placed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, gifts of leadership, different kinds of tongues. ###### v29 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they? ###### v30 Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak in tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they? ###### v31 But you should be eager for the greater gifts. And now I will show you a way that is beyond comparison.
