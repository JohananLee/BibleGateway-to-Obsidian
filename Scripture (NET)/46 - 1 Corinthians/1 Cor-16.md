A Collection to Aid Jewish Christians ###### 1 With regard to the collection for the saints, please follow the directions that I gave to the churches of Galatia: ###### v2 On the first day of the week, each of you should set aside some income and save it to the extent that God has blessed you, so that a collection will not have to be made when I come. ###### v3 Then, when I arrive, I will send those whom you approve with letters of explanation to carry your gift to Jerusalem. ###### v4 And if it seems advisable that I should go also, they will go with me.Paul's Plans to Visit ###### v5 But I will come to you after I have gone through Macedonia--for I will be going through Macedonia-- ###### v6 and perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, so that you can send me on my journey, wherever I go. ###### v7 For I do not want to see you now in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows. ###### v8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost, ###### v9 because a door of great opportunity stands wide open for me, but there are many opponents. ###### v10 Now if Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear among you, for he is doing the Lord's work, as I am too. ###### v11 So then, let no one treat him with contempt. But send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me. For I am expecting him with the brothers. ###### v12 With regard to our brother Apollos: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was simply not his intention to come now. He will come when he has the opportunity.Final Challenge and Blessing ###### v13 Stay alert, stand firm in the faith, show courage, be strong. ###### v14 Everything you do should be done in love. ###### v15 Now, brothers and sisters, you know about the household of Stephanus, that as the first converts of Achaia, they devoted themselves to ministry for the saints. I urge you ###### v16 also to submit to people like this, and to everyone who cooperates in the work and labors hard. ###### v17 I was glad about the arrival of Stephanus, Fortunatus, and Achaicus because they have supplied the fellowship with you that I lacked. ###### v18 For they refreshed my spirit and yours. So then, recognize people like this. ###### v19 The churches in the province of Asia send greetings to you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, with the church that meets in their house. ###### v20 All the brothers and sisters send greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. ###### v21 I, Paul, send this greeting with my own hand. ###### v22 Let anyone who has no love for the Lord be accursed. Our Lord, come! ###### v23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you. ###### v24 My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
