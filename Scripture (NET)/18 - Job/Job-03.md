**II. Job's Dialogue With His Friends ([3:1-27:23])**Job Regrets His Birth ###### 1 After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day he was born. ###### v2 Job spoke up and said: ###### v3 "Let the day on which I was born perish, and the night that said, 'A man has been conceived!' ###### v4 That day--let it be darkness; let not God on high regard it, nor let light shine on it! ###### v5 Let darkness and the deepest shadow claim it; let a cloud settle on it; let whatever blackens the day terrify it. ###### v6 That night--let darkness seize it; let it not be included among the days of the year; let it not enter among the number of the months! ###### v7 Indeed, let that night be barren; let no shout of joy penetrate it! ###### v8 Let those who curse the day curse it-- those who are prepared to rouse Leviathan. ###### v9 Let its morning stars be darkened; let it wait for daylight but find none, nor let it see the first rays of dawn, ###### v10 because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb on me, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.Job Wishes He Had Died at Birth ###### v11 "Why did I not die at birth, and why did I not expire as I came out of the womb? ###### v12 Why did the knees welcome me, and why were there two breasts that I might nurse at them? ###### v13 For now I would be lying down and would be quiet, I would be asleep and then at peace ###### v14 with kings and counselors of the earth who built for themselves places now desolate, ###### v15 or with princes who possessed gold, who filled their palaces with silver. ###### v16 Or why was I not buried like a stillborn infant, like infants who have never seen the light? ###### v17 There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest. ###### v18 There the prisoners relax together; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor. ###### v19 Small and great are there, and the slave is free from his master.Longing for Death ###### v20 "Why does God give light to one who is in misery, and life to those whose soul is bitter, ###### v21 to those who wait for death that does not come, and search for it more than for hidden treasures, ###### v22 who rejoice even to jubilation, and are exultant when they find the grave? ###### v23 Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, and whom God has hedged in? ###### v24 For my sighing comes in place of my food, and my groanings flow forth like water. ###### v25 For the very thing I dreaded has happened to me, and what I feared has come upon me. ###### v26 I have no ease, I have no quietness; I cannot rest; turmoil has come upon me."
