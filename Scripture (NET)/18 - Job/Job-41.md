The Description of Leviathan ###### 1 (40:25) "Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook, and tie down its tongue with a rope? ###### v2 Can you put a cord through its nose, or pierce its jaw with a hook? ###### v3 Will it make numerous supplications to you, will it speak to you with tender words? ###### v4 Will it make a pact with you, so you could take it as your slave for life? ###### v5 Can you play with it, like a bird, or tie it on a leash for your girls? ###### v6 Will partners bargain for it? Will they divide it up among the merchants? ###### v7 Can you fill its hide with harpoons or its head with fishing spears? ###### v8 If you lay your hand on it, you will remember the fight. Do not do it again! ###### v9 (41:1) See, his expectation is wrong, he is laid low even at the sight of it. ###### v10 Is it not fierce when it is awakened? Who is he, then, who can stand before it? ###### v11 Who has confronted me that I should repay? Everything under heaven belongs to me! ###### v12 I will not keep silent about its limbs, and the extent of its might, and the grace of its arrangement. ###### v13 Who can uncover its outer covering? Who can penetrate to the inside of its armor? ###### v14 Who can open the doors of its mouth? Its teeth all around are fearsome. ###### v15 Its back has rows of shields, shut up closely together as with a seal; ###### v16 each one is so close to the next that no air can come between them. ###### v17 They lock tightly together, one to the next; they cling together and cannot be separated. ###### v18 Its snorting throws out flashes of light; its eyes are like the red glow of dawn. ###### v19 Out of its mouth go flames, sparks of fire shoot forth! ###### v20 Smoke streams from its nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning rushes. ###### v21 Its breath sets coals ablaze and a flame shoots from its mouth. ###### v22 Strength lodges in its neck, and despair runs before it. ###### v23 The folds of its flesh are tightly joined; they are firm on it, immovable. ###### v24 Its heart is hard as rock, hard as a lower millstone. ###### v25 When it rises up, the mighty are terrified, at its thrashing about they withdraw. ###### v26 Whoever strikes it with a sword will have no effect, nor with the spear, arrow, or dart. ###### v27 It regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood. ###### v28 Arrows do not make it flee; slingstones become like chaff to it. ###### v29 A club is counted as a piece of straw; it laughs at the rattling of the lance. ###### v30 Its underparts are the sharp points of potsherds, it leaves its mark in the mud like a threshing sledge. ###### v31 It makes the deep boil like a cauldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment, ###### v32 It leaves a glistening wake behind it; one would think the deep had a head of white hair. ###### v33 The likes of it is not on earth, a creature without fear. ###### v34 It looks on every haughty being; it is king over all that are proud."
