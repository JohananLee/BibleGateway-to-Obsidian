Elihu Invites Job's Attention ###### 1 "But now, O Job, listen to my words, and hear everything I have to say. ###### v2 See now, I have opened my mouth; my tongue in my mouth has spoken. ###### v3 My words come from the uprightness of my heart, and my lips will utter knowledge sincerely. ###### v4 The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. ###### v5 Reply to me, if you can; set your arguments in order before me and take your stand. ###### v6 Look, I am just like you in relation to God; I too have been molded from clay. ###### v7 Therefore no fear of me should terrify you, nor should my pressure be heavy on you.Elihu Rejects Job's Plea of Innocence ###### v8 "Indeed, you have said in my hearing (I heard the sound of the words!): ###### v9 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean and have no iniquity. ###### v10 Yet God finds occasions with me; he regards me as his enemy. ###### v11 He puts my feet in shackles; he watches closely all my paths.' ###### v12 Now in this, you are not right--I answer you, for God is greater than a human being. ###### v13 Why do you contend against him, that he does not answer all a person's words?Elihu Disagrees With Job's View of God ###### v14 "For God speaks, the first time in one way, the second time in another, though a person does not perceive it. ###### v15 In a dream, a night vision, when deep sleep falls on people as they sleep in their beds. ###### v16 Then he gives a revelation to people, and terrifies them with warnings, ###### v17 to turn a person from his sin, and to cover a person's pride. ###### v18 He spares a person's life from corruption, his very life from crossing over the river. ###### v19 Or a person is chastened by pain on his bed, and with the continual strife of his bones, ###### v20 so that his life loathes food, and his soul rejects appetizing fare. ###### v21 His flesh wastes away from sight, and his bones, which were not seen, are easily visible. ###### v22 He draws near to the place of corruption, and his life to the messengers of death. ###### v23 If there is an angel beside him, one mediator out of a thousand, to tell a person what constitutes his uprightness; ###### v24 and if God is gracious to him and says, 'Spare him from going down to the place of corruption, I have found a ransom for him,' ###### v25 then his flesh is restored like a youth's; he returns to the days of his youthful vigor. ###### v26 He entreats God, and God delights in him, he sees God's face with rejoicing, and God restores to him his righteousness. ###### v27 That person sings to others, saying: 'I have sinned and falsified what is right, but I was not punished according to what I deserved. ###### v28 He redeemed my life from going down to the place of corruption, and my life sees the light!'Elihu's Appeal to Job ###### v29 "Indeed, God does all these things, twice, three times, in his dealings with a person, ###### v30 to turn back his life from the place of corruption, that he may be enlightened with the light of life. ###### v31 Pay attention, Job--listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. ###### v32 If you have any words, reply to me; speak, for I want to justify you. ###### v33 If not, you listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom."
