Job's Reply to Bildad ###### 1 Then Job answered: ###### v2 "Truly, I know that this is so. But how can a human be just before God? ###### v3 If someone wishes to contend with him, he cannot answer him one time in a thousand. ###### v4 He is wise in heart and mighty in strength-- who has resisted him and remained safe? ###### v5 He who removes mountains suddenly, who overturns them in his anger, ###### v6 he who shakes the earth out of its place so that its pillars tremble, ###### v7 he who commands the sun, and it does not shine and seals up the stars, ###### v8 he alone spreads out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea. ###### v9 He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the constellations of the southern sky; ###### v10 he does great and unsearchable things, and wonderful things without number. ###### v11 If he passes by me, I cannot see him, if he goes by, I cannot perceive him. ###### v12 If he snatches away, who can turn him back? Who dares to say to him, 'What are you doing?' ###### v13 God does not restrain his anger; under him the helpers of Rahab lie crushed.The Impossibility of Facing God in Court ###### v14 "How much less, then, can I answer him and choose my words to argue with him. ###### v15 Although I am innocent, I could not answer him; I could only plead with my judge for mercy. ###### v16 If I summoned him, and he answered me, I would not believe that he would be listening to my voice-- ###### v17 he who crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds for no reason. ###### v18 He does not allow me to recover my breath, for he fills me with bitterness. ###### v19 If it is a matter of strength, most certainly he is the strong one! And if it is a matter of justice, he will say, 'Who will summon me?' ###### v20 Although I am innocent, my mouth would condemn me, although I am blameless, it would declare me perverse. ###### v21 I am blameless. I do not know myself. I despise my life.Accusation of God's Justice ###### v22 "It is all one! That is why I say, 'He destroys the blameless and the guilty.' ###### v23 If a scourge brings sudden death, he mocks at the despair of the innocent. ###### v24 If a land has been given into the hand of a wicked man, he covers the faces of its judges; if it is not he, then who is it?Renewed Complaint ###### v25 "My days are swifter than a runner, they speed by without seeing happiness. ###### v26 They glide by like reed boats, like an eagle that swoops down on its prey. ###### v27 If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will change my expression and be cheerful,' ###### v28 I dread all my sufferings, for I know that you do not hold me blameless. ###### v29 If I am guilty, why then weary myself in vain? ###### v30 If I wash myself with snow-melt water, and make my hands clean with lye, ###### v31 then you plunge me into a slimy pit and my own clothes abhor me. ###### v32 For he is not a human being like I am, that I might answer him, that we might come together in judgment. ###### v33 Nor is there an arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both, ###### v34 who would take his rod away from me so that his terror would not make me afraid. ###### v35 Then would I speak and not fear him, but it is not so with me.
