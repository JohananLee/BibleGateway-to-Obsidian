###### 1 "Are you acquainted with the way the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch as the wild deer give birth to their young? ###### v2 Do you count the months they must fulfill, and do you know the time they give birth? ###### v3 They crouch, they bear their young, they bring forth the offspring they have carried. ###### v4 Their young grow strong, and grow up in the open; they go off, and do not return to them. ###### v5 Who let the wild donkey go free? Who released the bonds of the donkey, ###### v6 to whom I appointed the arid rift valley for its home, the salt wastes as its dwelling place? ###### v7 It scorns the tumult in the town; it does not hear the shouts of a driver. ###### v8 It ranges the hills as its pasture, and searches after every green plant. ###### v9 Is the wild ox willing to be your servant? Will it spend the night at your feeding trough? ###### v10 Can you bind the wild ox to a furrow with its rope, will it till the valleys, following after you? ###### v11 Will you rely on it because its strength is great? Will you commit your labor to it? ###### v12 Can you count on it to bring in your grain, and gather the grain to your threshing floor? ###### v13 "The wings of the ostrich flap with joy, but are they the pinions and plumage of a stork? ###### v14 For she leaves her eggs on the ground, and lets them be warmed on the soil. ###### v15 She forgets that a foot might crush them, or that a wild animal might trample them. ###### v16 She is harsh with her young, as if they were not hers; she is unconcerned about the uselessness of her labor. ###### v17 For God deprived her of wisdom, and did not impart understanding to her. ###### v18 But as soon as she springs up, she laughs at the horse and its rider. ###### v19 "Do you give the horse its strength? Do you clothe its neck with a mane? ###### v20 Do you make it leap like a locust? Its proud neighing is terrifying! ###### v21 It paws the ground in the valley, exulting mightily, it goes out to meet the weapons. ###### v22 It laughs at fear and is not dismayed; it does not shy away from the sword. ###### v23 On it the quiver rattles; the lance and javelin flash. ###### v24 In excitement and impatience it consumes the ground; it cannot stand still when the trumpet is blown. ###### v25 At the sound of the trumpet, it says, 'Aha!' And from a distance it catches the scent of battle, the thunderous shouting of commanders, and the battle cries. ###### v26 "Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars, and spreads its wings toward the south? ###### v27 Is it at your command that the eagle soars, and builds its nest on high? ###### v28 It lives on a rock and spends the night there, on a rocky crag and a fortress. ###### v29 From there it spots its prey, its eyes gaze intently from a distance. ###### v30 And its young ones devour the blood, and where the dead carcasses are, there it is."
