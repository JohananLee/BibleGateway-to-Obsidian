A Protest of Innocence ###### 1 And Job took up his discourse again: ###### v2 "As surely as God lives, who has denied me justice, the Almighty, who has made my life bitter-- ###### v3 for while my spirit is still in me, and the breath from God is in my nostrils, ###### v4 my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will whisper no deceit. ###### v5 I will never declare that you three are in the right; until I die, I will not set aside my integrity! ###### v6 I will maintain my righteousness and never let it go; my conscience will not reproach me for as long as I live.The Condition of the Wicked ###### v7 "May my enemy be like the wicked, my adversary like the unrighteous. ###### v8 For what hope does the godless have when he is cut off, when God takes away his life? ###### v9 Does God listen to his cry when distress overtakes him? ###### v10 Will he find delight in the Almighty? Will he call out to God at all times? ###### v11 I will teach you about the power of God; what is on the Almighty's mind I will not conceal. ###### v12 If you yourselves have all seen this, Why in the world do you continue this meaningless talk? ###### v13 This is the portion of the wicked man allotted by God, the inheritance that evildoers receive from the Almighty. ###### v14 If his children increase--it is for the sword! His offspring never have enough to eat. ###### v15 Those who survive him are buried by the plague, and their widows do not mourn for them. ###### v16 If he piles up silver like dust and stores up clothing like mounds of clay, ###### v17 what he stores up a righteous man will wear, and an innocent man will inherit his silver. ###### v18 The house he builds is as fragile as a moth's cocoon, like a hut that a watchman has made. ###### v19 He goes to bed wealthy, but will do so no more. When he opens his eyes, it is all gone. ###### v20 Terrors overwhelm him like a flood; at night a whirlwind carries him off. ###### v21 The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. ###### v22 It hurls itself against him without pity as he flees headlong from its power. ###### v23 It claps its hands at him in derision and hisses him away from his place.
