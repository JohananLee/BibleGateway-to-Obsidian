Job's Reply to Eliphaz ###### 1 Then Job replied: ###### v2 "I have heard many things like these before. What miserable comforters are you all! ###### v3 Will there be an end to your windy words? Or what provokes you that you answer? ###### v4 I also could speak like you, if you were in my place; I could pile up words against you and I could shake my head at you. ###### v5 But I would strengthen you with my words; comfort from my lips would bring you relief.Abandonment by God and Man ###### v6 "But if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I refrain from speaking, how much of it goes away? ###### v7 Surely now he has worn me out, you have devastated my entire household. ###### v8 You have seized me, and it has become a witness; my leanness has risen up against me and testifies against me. ###### v9 His anger has torn me and persecuted me; he has gnashed at me with his teeth; my adversary locks his eyes on me. ###### v10 People have opened their mouths against me, they have struck my cheek in scorn; they unite together against me. ###### v11 God abandons me to evil men, and throws me into the hands of wicked men. ###### v12 I was in peace, and he has shattered me. He has seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has made me his target; ###### v13 his archers surround me. Without pity he pierces my kidneys and pours out my gall on the ground. ###### v14 He breaks through against me, time and time again; he rushes against me like a warrior. ###### v15 I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and buried my horn in the dust; ###### v16 my face is reddened because of weeping, and on my eyelids there is a deep darkness, ###### v17 although there is no violence in my hands and my prayer is pure.An Appeal to God as Witness ###### v18 "O earth, do not cover my blood, nor let there be a secret place for my cry. ###### v19 Even now my witness is in heaven; my advocate is on high. ###### v20 My intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to God; ###### v21 and he contends with God on behalf of man as a man pleads for his friend. ###### v22 For the years that lie ahead are few, and then I will go on the way of no return.
