Job Replies to Eliphaz ###### 1 Then Job responded: ###### v2 "Oh, if only my grief could be weighed, and my misfortune laid on the scales too! ###### v3 But because it is heavier than the sand of the sea, that is why my words have been wild. ###### v4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; my spirit drinks their poison; God's sudden terrors are arrayed against me.Complaints Reflect Suffering ###### v5 "Does the wild donkey bray when it is near grass? Or does the ox bellow over its fodder? ###### v6 Can food that is tasteless be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg? ###### v7 I have refused to touch such things; they are like loathsome food to me.A Cry for Death ###### v8 "Oh that my request would be realized, and that God would grant me what I long for! ###### v9 And that God would be willing to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and kill me. ###### v10 Then I would yet have my comfort, then I would rejoice, in spite of pitiless pain, for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. ###### v11 What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should prolong my life? ###### v12 Is my strength like that of stones? Or is my flesh made of bronze? ###### v13 Is not my power to help myself nothing, and has not every resource been driven from me?Disappointing Friends ###### v14 "To the one in despair, kindness should come from his friend even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty. ###### v15 My brothers have been as treacherous as a seasonal stream, and as the riverbeds of the intermittent streams that flow away. ###### v16 They are dark because of ice; snow is piled up over them. ###### v17 When they are scorched, they dry up, when it is hot, they vanish from their place. ###### v18 Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go into the wasteland and perish. ###### v19 The caravans of Tema looked intently for these streams; the traveling merchants of Sheba hoped for them. ###### v20 They were distressed, because each one had been so confident; they arrived there, but were disappointed. ###### v21 For now you have become like these streams that are no help; you see a terror, and are afraid.Friends' Fears ###### v22 "Have I ever said, 'Give me something, and from your fortune make gifts in my favor'? ###### v23 Or, 'Deliver me from the enemy's power, and from the hand of tyrants ransom me'?No Sin Discovered ###### v24 "Teach me and I, for my part, will be silent; explain to me how I have been mistaken. ###### v25 How painful are honest words! But what does your reproof prove? ###### v26 Do you intend to criticize mere words, and treat the words of a despairing man as wind? ###### v27 Yes, you would gamble for the fatherless, and auction off your friend.Other Explanation ###### v28 "Now then, be good enough to look at me; and I will not lie to your face! ###### v29 Relent, let there be no falsehood; reconsider, for my righteousness is intact! ###### v30 Is there any falsehood on my lips? Can my mouth not discern evil things?
