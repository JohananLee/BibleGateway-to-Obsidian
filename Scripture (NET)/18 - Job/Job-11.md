Zophar's First Speech to Job ###### 1 Then Zophar the Naamathite spoke up and said: ###### v2 "Should not this abundance of words be answered, or should this talkative man be vindicated? ###### v3 Should people remain silent at your idle talk, and should no one rebuke you when you mock? ###### v4 For you have said, 'My teaching is flawless, and I am pure in your sight.' ###### v5 But if only God would speak, if only he would open his lips against you, ###### v6 and reveal to you the secrets of wisdom-- for true wisdom has two sides-- so that you would know that God has forgiven some of your sins. ###### v7 "Can you discover the essence of God? Can you find out the perfection of the Almighty? ###### v8 It is higher than the heavens--what can you do? It is deeper than Sheol--what can you know? ###### v9 Its measure is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea. ###### v10 If he comes by and confines you and convenes a court, then who can prevent him? ###### v11 For he knows deceitful men; when he sees evil, will he not consider it? ###### v12 But an empty man will become wise, when a wild donkey's colt is born a human being. ###### v13 "As for you, if you prove faithful, and if you stretch out your hands toward him, ###### v14 if iniquity is in your hand--put it far away, and do not let evil reside in your tents. ###### v15 For then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be securely established and will not fear. ###### v16 For you will forget your trouble; you will remember it like water that has flowed away. ###### v17 And life will be brighter than the noonday; though there be darkness, it will be like the morning. ###### v18 And you will be secure, because there is hope; you will be protected and will take your rest in safety. ###### v19 You will lie down with no one to make you afraid, and many will seek your favor. ###### v20 But the eyes of the wicked fail, and escape eludes them; their one hope is to breathe their last."
