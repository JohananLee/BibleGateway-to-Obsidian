Job Vindicates Himself ###### 1 "I made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I entertain thoughts against a virgin? ###### v2 What then would be one's lot from God above, one's heritage from the Almighty on high? ###### v3 Is it not misfortune for the unjust, and disaster for those who work iniquity? ###### v4 Does he not see my ways and count all my steps? ###### v5 If I have walked in falsehood, and if my foot has hastened to deceit-- ###### v6 let him weigh me with honest scales; then God will discover my integrity. ###### v7 If my footsteps have strayed from the way, if my heart has gone after my eyes, or if anything has defiled my hands, ###### v8 then let me sow and let another eat, and let my crops be uprooted. ###### v9 If my heart has been enticed by a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door, ###### v10 then let my wife turn the millstone for another man, and may other men commit adultery with her. ###### v11 For I would have committed a shameful act, an iniquity to be judged. ###### v12 For it is a fire that devours even to Destruction, and it would uproot all my harvest. ###### v13 "If I have disregarded the right of my male servants or my female servants when they disputed with me, ###### v14 then what will I do when God confronts me in judgment; when he intervenes, how will I respond to him? ###### v15 Did not the one who made me in the womb make them? Did not the same one form us in the womb? ###### v16 If I have refused to give the poor what they desired, or caused the eyes of the widow to fail, ###### v17 If I ate my morsel of bread myself, and did not share any of it with orphans-- ###### v18 but from my youth I raised the orphan like a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow-- ###### v19 If I have seen anyone about to perish for lack of clothing, or a poor man without a coat, ###### v20 whose heart did not bless me as he warmed himself with the fleece of my sheep, ###### v21 if I have raised my hand to vote against the orphan, when I saw my support in the court, ###### v22 then let my arm fall from the shoulder, let my arm be broken off at the socket. ###### v23 For the calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his majesty I was powerless. ###### v24 "If I have put my confidence in gold or said to pure gold, 'You are my security!' ###### v25 if I have rejoiced because of the extent of my wealth, or because of the great wealth my hand had gained, ###### v26 if I looked at the sun when it was shining, and the moon advancing as a precious thing, ###### v27 so that my heart was secretly enticed, and my hand threw them a kiss from my mouth, ###### v28 then this also would be iniquity to be judged, for I would have been false to God above. ###### v29 If I have rejoiced over the misfortune of my enemy or exulted because calamity found him-- ###### v30 I have not even permitted my mouth to sin by asking for his life through a curse-- ###### v31 if the members of my household have never said, 'If only there were someone who has not been satisfied from Job's meat!'-- ###### v32 But no stranger had to spend the night outside, for I opened my doors to the traveler-- ###### v33 if I have covered my transgressions as men do, by hiding iniquity in my heart, ###### v34 because I was terrified of the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I remained silent and would not go outdoors--Job's Appeal ###### v35 "If only I had someone to hear me! Here is my signature-- let the Almighty answer me! If only I had an indictment that my accuser had written. ###### v36 Surely I would wear it proudly on my shoulder, I would bind it on me like a crown; ###### v37 I would give him an accounting of my steps; like a prince I would draw near to him.Job's Final Solemn Oath ###### v38 "If my land cried out against me and all its furrows wept together, ###### v39 if I have eaten its produce without paying, or caused the death of its owners, ###### v40 then let thorns sprout up in place of wheat, and in place of barley, noxious weeds." The words of Job are ended.
