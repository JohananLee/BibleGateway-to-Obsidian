Job Pleads His Cause to God ###### 1 "Indeed, my eyes have seen all this, my ears have heard and understood it. ###### v2 What you know, I know also; I am not inferior to you! ###### v3 But I wish to speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God. ###### v4 But you, however, are inventors of lies; all of you are worthless physicians! ###### v5 If only you would keep completely silent! For you, that would be wisdom. ###### v6 "Listen now to my argument, and be attentive to my lips' contentions. ###### v7 Will you speak wickedly on God's behalf? Will you speak deceitfully for him? ###### v8 Will you show him partiality? Will you argue the case for God? ###### v9 Would it turn out well if he would examine you? Or as one deceives a man would you deceive him? ###### v10 He would certainly rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality. ###### v11 Would not his splendor terrify you and the fear he inspires fall on you? ###### v12 Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. ###### v13 "Refrain from talking with me so that I may speak; then let come to me what may. ###### v14 Why do I put myself in peril, and take my life in my hands? ###### v15 Even if he slays me, I will hope in him; I will surely defend my ways to his face. ###### v16 Moreover, this will become my deliverance, for no godless person would come before him. ###### v17 Listen carefully to my words; let your ears be attentive to my explanation. ###### v18 See now, I have prepared my case; I know that I am right. ###### v19 Who will contend with me? If anyone can, I will be silent and die. ###### v20 Only in two things spare me, O God, and then I will not hide from your face: ###### v21 Remove your hand far from me and stop making me afraid with your terror. ###### v22 Then call, and I will answer, or I will speak, and you respond to me. ###### v23 How many are my iniquities and sins? Show me my transgression and my sin. ###### v24 Why do you hide your face and regard me as your enemy? ###### v25 Do you wish to torment a windblown leaf and chase after dry chaff? ###### v26 For you write down bitter things against me and cause me to inherit the sins of my youth. ###### v27 And you put my feet in the stocks and you watch all my movements; you put marks on the soles of my feet. ###### v28 So I waste away like something rotten, like a garment eaten by moths.
