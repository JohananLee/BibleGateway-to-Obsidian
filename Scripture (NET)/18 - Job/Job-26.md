Job's Reply to Bildad ###### 1 Then Job replied: ###### v2 "How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the person who has no strength! ###### v3 How you have advised the one without wisdom, and abundantly revealed your insight! ###### v4 To whom did you utter these words? And whose spirit has come forth from your mouth?A Better Description of God's Greatness ###### v5 "The dead tremble-- those beneath the waters and all that live in them. ###### v6 The underworld is naked before God; the place of destruction lies uncovered. ###### v7 He spreads out the northern skies over empty space; he suspends the earth on nothing. ###### v8 He locks the waters in his clouds, and the clouds do not burst with the weight of them. ###### v9 He conceals the face of the full moon, shrouding it with his clouds. ###### v10 He marks out the horizon on the surface of the waters as a boundary between light and darkness. ###### v11 The pillars of the heavens tremble and are amazed at his rebuke. ###### v12 By his power he stills the sea; by his wisdom he cut Rahab the great sea monster to pieces. ###### v13 By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent. ###### v14 Indeed, these are but the outer fringes of his ways! How faint is the whisper we hear of him! But who can understand the thunder of his power?"
