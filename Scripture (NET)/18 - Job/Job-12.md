Job's Reply to Zophar ###### 1 Then Job answered: ###### v2 "Without a doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you. ###### v3 I also have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these? ###### v4 I am a laughingstock to my friends, I, who called on God and whom he answered-- a righteous and blameless man is a laughingstock! ###### v5 For calamity, there is derision (according to the ideas of the fortunate)-- a fate for those whose feet slip. ###### v6 But the tents of robbers are peaceful, and those who provoke God are confident-- who carry their god in their hands.Knowledge of God's Wisdom ###### v7 "But now, ask the animals and they will teach you, or the birds of the sky and they will tell you. ###### v8 Or speak to the earth and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea declare to you. ###### v9 Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this? ###### v10 In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all the human race. ###### v11 Does not the ear test words, as the tongue tastes food? ###### v12 Is not wisdom found among the aged? Does not long life bring understanding? ###### v13 "With God are wisdom and power; counsel and understanding are his. ###### v14 If he tears down, it cannot be rebuilt; if he imprisons a person, there is no escape. ###### v15 If he holds back the waters, then they dry up; if he releases them, they destroy the land. ###### v16 With him are strength and prudence; both the one who goes astray and the one who misleads are his. ###### v17 He leads counselors away stripped and makes judges into fools. ###### v18 He loosens the bonds of kings and binds a loincloth around their waist. ###### v19 He leads priests away stripped and overthrows the potentates. ###### v20 He deprives the trusted advisers of speech and takes away the discernment of elders. ###### v21 He pours contempt on noblemen and disarms the powerful. ###### v22 He reveals the deep things of darkness, and brings deep shadows into the light. ###### v23 He makes nations great, and destroys them; he extends the boundaries of nations and disperses them. ###### v24 He deprives the leaders of the earth of their understanding; he makes them wander in a trackless desert waste. ###### v25 They grope about in darkness without light; he makes them stagger like drunkards.
