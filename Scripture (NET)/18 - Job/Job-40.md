Job's Reply to God's Challenge ###### 1 Then the LORD answered Job: ###### v2 "Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him? Let the person who accuses God give him an answer!" ###### v3 Then Job answered the LORD: ###### v4 "Indeed, I am completely unworthy--how could I reply to you? I put my hand over my mouth to silence myself. ###### v5 I have spoken once, but I cannot answer; twice, but I will say no more."The Lord's Second Speech ###### v6 Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind: ###### v7 "Get ready for a difficult task like a man. I will question you and you will inform me. ###### v8 Would you indeed annul my justice? Would you declare me guilty so that you might be right? ###### v9 Do you have an arm as powerful as God's, and can you thunder with a voice like his? ###### v10 Adorn yourself, then, with majesty and excellency, and clothe yourself with glory and honor. ###### v11 Scatter abroad the abundance of your anger. Look at every proud man and bring him low; ###### v12 Look at every proud man and abase him; crush the wicked on the spot. ###### v13 Hide them in the dust together, imprison them in the grave. ###### v14 Then I myself will acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you.The Description of Behemoth ###### v15 "Look now at Behemoth, which I made as I made you; it eats grass like the ox. ###### v16 Look at its strength in its loins, and its power in the muscles of its belly. ###### v17 It makes its tail stiff like a cedar, the sinews of its thighs are tightly wound. ###### v18 Its bones are tubes of bronze, its limbs like bars of iron. ###### v19 It ranks first among the works of God, the One who made it has furnished it with a sword. ###### v20 For the hills bring it food, where all the wild animals play. ###### v21 Under the lotus trees it lies, in the secrecy of the reeds and the marsh. ###### v22 The lotus trees conceal it in their shadow; the poplars by the stream conceal it. ###### v23 If the river rages, it is not disturbed, it is secure, though the Jordan should surge up to its mouth. ###### v24 Can anyone catch it by its eyes, or pierce its nose with a snare?
