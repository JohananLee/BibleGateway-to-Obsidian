###### 1 My spirit is broken, my days have faded out, the grave awaits me. ###### v2 Surely mockery is with me; my eyes must dwell on their hostility. ###### v3 Set my pledge beside you. Who else will put up security for me? ###### v4 Because you have closed their minds to understanding, therefore you will not exalt them. ###### v5 If a man denounces his friends for personal gain, the eyes of his children will fail. ###### v6 He has made me a byword to people, I am the one in whose face they spit. ###### v7 My eyes have grown dim with grief; my whole frame is but a shadow. ###### v8 Upright men are appalled at this; the innocent man is troubled with the godless. ###### v9 But the righteous man holds to his way, and the one with clean hands grows stronger.Anticipation of Death ###### v10 "But turn, all of you, and come now! I will not find a wise man among you. ###### v11 My days have passed, my plans are shattered, even the desires of my heart. ###### v12 These men change night into day; they say, 'The light is near in the face of darkness.' ###### v13 If I hope for the grave to be my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness, ###### v14 if I cry out to corruption, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,' ###### v15 where then is my hope? And my hope, who sees it? ###### v16 Will it go down to the barred gates of death? Will we descend together into the dust?"
