Elihu's Second Speech ###### 1 Elihu answered: ###### v2 "Listen to my words, you wise men; hear me, you learned men. ###### v3 For the ear assesses words as the mouth tastes food. ###### v4 Let us evaluate for ourselves what is right; let us come to know among ourselves what is good. ###### v5 For Job says, 'I am innocent, but God turns away my right. ###### v6 Concerning my right, should I lie? My wound is incurable, although I am without transgression.' ###### v7 Who is there like Job, who drinks derision like water? ###### v8 He goes about in company with evildoers, he goes along with wicked men. ###### v9 For he says, 'It does not profit a man when he makes his delight with God.'God is Not Unjust ###### v10 "Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wickedness, from the Almighty to do evil. ###### v11 For he repays a person for his work, and according to the conduct of a person, he causes the consequences to find him. ###### v12 Indeed, in truth, God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice. ###### v13 Who entrusted to him the earth? And who put him over the whole world? ###### v14 If God were to set his heart on it, and gather in his spirit and his breath, ###### v15 all flesh would perish together and human beings would return to dust.God Is Impartial and Omniscient ###### v16 "If you have understanding, listen to this, hear what I have to say. ###### v17 Do you really think that one who hates justice can govern? And will you declare guilty the supremely Righteous One, ###### v18 who says to a king, 'Worthless man,' and to nobles, 'Wicked men,' ###### v19 who shows no partiality to princes, and does not take note of the rich more than the poor, because all of them are the work of his hands? ###### v20 In a moment they die, in the middle of the night, people are shaken and they pass away. The mighty are removed effortlessly. ###### v21 For his eyes are on the ways of an individual, he observes all a person's steps. ###### v22 There is no darkness, and no deep darkness, where evildoers can hide themselves. ###### v23 For he does not still consider a person, that he should come before God in judgment. ###### v24 He shatters the great without inquiry, and sets up others in their place. ###### v25 Therefore, he knows their deeds, he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed. ###### v26 He strikes them for their wickedness, in a place where people can see, ###### v27 because they have turned away from following him, and have not understood any of his ways, ###### v28 so that they caused the cry of the poor to come before him, so that he hears the cry of the needy. ###### v29 But if God is quiet, who can condemn him? If he hides his face, then who can see him? Yet he is over the individual and the nation alike, ###### v30 so that the godless man should not rule, and not lay snares for the people.Job Is Foolish to Rebel ###### v31 "Has anyone said to God, 'I have endured chastisement, but I will not act wrongly any more; ###### v32 teach me what I cannot see; if I have done evil, I will do so no more'? ###### v33 Is it your opinion that God should recompense it, because you reject this? But you must choose, and not I, so tell us what you know. ###### v34 Men of understanding say to me-- any wise man listening to me says-- ###### v35 that Job speaks without knowledge and his words are without understanding. ###### v36 But Job will be tested to the end, because his answers are like those of wicked men. ###### v37 For he adds transgression to his sin; in our midst he claps his hands, and multiplies his words against God."
