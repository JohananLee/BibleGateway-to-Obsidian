**IV. Job's Concluding Soliloquy ([29:1-31:40])**Job Recalls His Former Condition ###### 1 Then Job continued his speech: ###### v2 "O that I could be as I was in the months now gone, in the days when God watched over me, ###### v3 when he caused his lamp to shine upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness; ###### v4 just as I was in my most productive time, when God's intimate friendship was experienced in my tent, ###### v5 when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me; ###### v6 when my steps were bathed with butter and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil! ###### v7 When I went out to the city gate and secured my seat in the public square, ###### v8 the young men would see me and step aside, and the old men would get up and remain standing; ###### v9 the chief men refrained from talking and covered their mouths with their hands; ###### v10 the voices of the nobles fell silent, and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.Job's Benevolence ###### v11 "As soon as the ear heard these things, it blessed me, and when the eye saw them, it bore witness to me, ###### v12 for I rescued the poor who cried out for help, and the orphan who had no one to assist him; ###### v13 the blessing of the dying man descended on me, and I made the widow's heart rejoice; ###### v14 I put on righteousness and it clothed me, my just dealing was like a robe and a turban; ###### v15 I was eyes for the blind and feet for the lame; ###### v16 I was a father to the needy, and I investigated the case of the person I did not know; ###### v17 I broke the fangs of the wicked, and made him drop his prey from his teeth.Job's Confidence ###### v18 "Then I thought, 'I will die in my own home, my days as numerous as the grains of sand. ###### v19 My roots reach the water, and the dew lies on my branches all night long. ###### v20 My glory will always be fresh in me, and my bow ever new in my hand.'Job's Reputation ###### v21 "People listened to me and waited silently; they kept silent for my advice. ###### v22 After I had spoken, they did not respond; my words fell on them drop by drop. ###### v23 They waited for me as people wait for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rains. ###### v24 If I smiled at them, they hardly believed it; and they did not cause the light of my face to darken. ###### v25 I chose the way for them and sat as their chief; I lived like a king among his troops; I was like one who comforts mourners.
