Elihu's Third Speech ###### 1 Then Elihu answered: ###### v2 "Do you think this to be just when you say, 'My right before God'? ###### v3 But you say, 'What will it profit you,' and, 'What do I gain by not sinning?' ###### v4 I will reply to you, and to your friends with you. ###### v5 Gaze at the heavens and see; consider the clouds, which are higher than you. ###### v6 If you sin, how does it affect God? If your transgressions are many, what does it do to him? ###### v7 If you are righteous, what do you give to God, or what does he receive from your hand? ###### v8 Your wickedness affects only a person like yourself, and your righteousness only other people. ###### v9 "People cry out because of the excess of oppression; they cry out for help because of the power of the mighty. ###### v10 But no one says, 'Where is God, my Creator, who gives songs in the night, ###### v11 who teaches us more than the wild animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?' ###### v12 Then they cry out--but he does not answer-- because of the arrogance of the wicked. ###### v13 Surely it is an empty cry--God does not hear it; the Almighty does not take notice of it. ###### v14 How much less, then, when you say that you do not perceive him, that the case is before him and you are waiting for him! ###### v15 And further, when you say that his anger does not punish, and that he does not know transgression! ###### v16 So Job opens his mouth to no purpose; without knowledge he multiplies words."
