The Brevity of Life ###### 1 "Man, born of woman, lives but a few days, and they are full of trouble. ###### v2 He grows up like a flower and then withers away; he flees like a shadow, and does not remain. ###### v3 Do you fix your eye on such a one? And do you bring me before you for judgment? ###### v4 Who can make a clean thing come from an unclean? No one! ###### v5 Since man's days are determined, the number of his months is under your control; you have set his limit and he cannot pass it. ###### v6 Look away from him and let him desist, until he fulfills his time like a hired man.The Inevitability of Death ###### v7 "But there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its new shoots will not fail. ###### v8 Although its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump begins to die in the soil, ###### v9 at the scent of water it will flourish and put forth shoots like a new plant. ###### v10 But man dies and is powerless; he expires--and where is he? ###### v11 As water disappears from the sea, or a river drains away and dries up, ###### v12 so man lies down and does not rise; until the heavens are no more, they will not awake nor arise from their sleep.The Possibility of Another Life ###### v13 "O that you would hide me in Sheol, and conceal me till your anger has passed! O that you would set me a time and then remember me! ###### v14 If a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait until my release comes. ###### v15 You will call and I--I will answer you; you will long for the creature you have made.The Present Condition ###### v16 "Surely now you count my steps; then you would not mark my sin. ###### v17 My offenses would be sealed up in a bag; you would cover over my sin. ###### v18 But as a mountain falls away and crumbles, and as a rock will be removed from its place, ###### v19 as water wears away stones, and torrents wash away the soil, so you destroy man's hope. ###### v20 You overpower him once for all, and he departs; you change his appearance and send him away. ###### v21 If his sons are honored, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he does not see it. ###### v22 His flesh only has pain for him, and he mourns for himself."
