Bildad's First Speech to Job ###### 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite spoke up and said: ###### v2 "How long will you speak these things, seeing that the words of your mouth are like a great wind? ###### v3 Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert what is right? ###### v4 If your children sinned against him, he gave them over to the penalty of their sin. ###### v5 But if you will look to God, and make your supplication to the Almighty, ###### v6 if you become pure and upright, even now he will rouse himself for you, and will restore your righteous home. ###### v7 Your beginning will seem so small, since your future will flourish. ###### v8 "For inquire now of the former generation, and pay attention to the findings of their ancestors; ###### v9 For we were born yesterday and do not have knowledge, since our days on earth are but a shadow. ###### v10 Will they not instruct you and speak to you, and bring forth words from their understanding? ###### v11 Can the papyrus plant grow tall where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish without water? ###### v12 While they are still beginning to flower and not ripe for cutting, they can wither away faster than any grass. ###### v13 Such is the destiny of all who forget God; the hope of the godless perishes, ###### v14 whose trust is in something futile, whose security is a spider's web. ###### v15 He leans against his house but it does not hold up, he takes hold of it but it does not stand. ###### v16 He is a well-watered plant in the sun, its shoots spread over its garden. ###### v17 It wraps its roots around a heap of stones and it looks for a place among stones. ###### v18 If he is uprooted from his place, then that place will disown him, saying, 'I have never seen you!' ###### v19 Indeed, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth others spring up. ###### v20 "Surely, God does not reject a blameless man, nor does he grasp the hand of the evildoers. ###### v21 He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with gladness. ###### v22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more."
