Job's Present Misery ###### 1 "But now they mock me, those who are younger than I, whose fathers I disdained too much to put with my sheep dogs. ###### v2 Moreover, the strength of their hands-- what use was it to me? Those whose strength had perished, ###### v3 gaunt with want and hunger, they would roam the parched land, by night a desolate waste. ###### v4 By the brush they would gather herbs from the salt marshes, and the root of the broom tree was their food. ###### v5 They were banished from the community-- people shouted at them as they would shout at thieves-- ###### v6 so that they had to live in the dry stream beds, in the holes of the ground, and among the rocks. ###### v7 They brayed like animals among the bushes and were huddled together under the nettles. ###### v8 Sons of senseless and nameless people, they were driven out of the land with whips.Job's Indignities ###### v9 "And now I have become their taunt song; I have become a byword among them. ###### v10 They detest me and maintain their distance; they do not hesitate to spit in my face. ###### v11 Because God has untied my tent cord and afflicted me, people throw off all restraint in my presence. ###### v12 On my right the young rabble rise up; they drive me from place to place, and build up siege ramps against me. ###### v13 They destroy my path; they succeed in destroying me without anyone assisting them. ###### v14 They come in as through a wide breach; amid the crash they come rolling in. ###### v15 Terrors are turned loose on me; they drive away my honor like the wind, and as a cloud my deliverance has passed away.Job's Despondency ###### v16 "And now my soul pours itself out within me; days of suffering take hold of me. ###### v17 Night pierces my bones; my gnawing pains never cease. ###### v18 With great power God grasps my clothing; he binds me like the collar of my tunic. ###### v19 He has flung me into the mud, and I have come to resemble dust and ashes. ###### v20 I cry out to you, but you do not answer me; I stand up, and you only look at me. ###### v21 You have become cruel to me; with the strength of your hand you attack me. ###### v22 You pick me up on the wind and make me ride on it; you toss me about in the storm. ###### v23 I know that you are bringing me to death, to the meeting place for all the living.The Contrast With the Past ###### v24 "Surely one does not stretch out his hand against a broken man when he cries for help in his distress. ###### v25 Have I not wept for the unfortunate? Was not my soul grieved for the poor? ###### v26 But when I hoped for good, trouble came; when I expected light, then darkness came. ###### v27 My heart is in turmoil unceasingly; the days of my affliction confront me. ###### v28 I go about blackened, but not by the sun; in the assembly I stand up and cry for help. ###### v29 I have become a brother to jackals and a companion of ostriches. ###### v30 My skin has turned dark on me; my body is hot with fever. ###### v31 My harp is used for mourning and my flute for the sound of weeping.
