Job's Reply to Bildad ###### 1 Then Job answered: ###### v2 "How long will you torment me and crush me with your words? ###### v3 These ten times you have been reproaching me; you are not ashamed to attack me. ###### v4 But even if it were true that I have erred, my error remains solely my concern! ###### v5 If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and plead my disgrace against me, ###### v6 know then that God has wronged me and encircled me with his net.Job's Abandonment and Affliction ###### v7 "If I cry out, 'Violence!' I receive no answer; I cry for help, but there is no justice. ###### v8 He has blocked my way so I cannot pass, and has set darkness over my paths. ###### v9 He has stripped me of my honor and has taken the crown off my head. ###### v10 He tears me down on every side until I perish; he uproots my hope like an uprooted tree. ###### v11 Thus his anger burns against me, and he considers me among his enemies. ###### v12 His troops advance together; they throw up a siege ramp against me, and they camp around my tent.Job's Forsaken State ###### v13 "He has put my relatives far from me; my acquaintances only turn away from me. ###### v14 My kinsmen have failed me; my friends have forgotten me. ###### v15 My guests and my servant girls consider me a stranger; I am a foreigner in their eyes. ###### v16 I summon my servant, but he does not respond, even though I implore him with my own mouth. ###### v17 My breath is repulsive to my wife; I am loathsome to my brothers. ###### v18 Even youngsters have scorned me; when I get up, they scoff at me. ###### v19 All my closest friends detest me; and those whom I love have turned against me. ###### v20 My bones stick to my skin and my flesh; I have escaped alive with only the skin of my teeth. ###### v21 Have pity on me, my friends, have pity on me, for the hand of God has struck me. ###### v22 Why do you pursue me like God does? Will you never be satiated with my flesh?Job's Assurance of Vindication ###### v23 "O that my words were written down! O that they were written on a scroll! ###### v24 O that with an iron chisel and with lead they were engraved in a rock forever! ###### v25 As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and that as the last he will stand upon the earth. ###### v26 And after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God, ###### v27 whom I will see for myself, and whom my own eyes will behold, and not another. My heart grows faint within me. ###### v28 If you say, 'How we will pursue him, since the root of the trouble is found in him!' ###### v29 Fear the sword yourselves, for wrath brings the punishment by the sword, so that you may know that there is judgment."
