Job's Reply to Zophar ###### 1 Then Job answered: ###### v2 "Listen carefully to my words; let this be the consolation you offer me. ###### v3 Bear with me and I will speak, and after I have spoken you may mock. ###### v4 Is my complaint against a man? If so, why should I not be impatient? ###### v5 Look at me and be appalled; put your hands over your mouths. ###### v6 For, when I think about this, I am terrified and my body feels a shudder.The Wicked Prosper ###### v7 "Why do the wicked go on living, grow old, even increase in power? ###### v8 Their children are firmly established in their presence, their offspring before their eyes. ###### v9 Their houses are safe and without fear; and no rod of punishment from God is upon them. ###### v10 Their bulls breed without fail; their cows calve and do not miscarry. ###### v11 They allow their children to run like a flock; their little ones dance about. ###### v12 They sing to the accompaniment of tambourine and harp, and make merry to the sound of the flute. ###### v13 They live out their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace. ###### v14 So they say to God, 'Turn away from us! We do not want to know your ways. ###### v15 Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What would we gain if we were to pray to him?' ###### v16 But their prosperity is not their own doing. The counsel of the wicked is far from me!How Often Do the Wicked Suffer? ###### v17 "How often is the lamp of the wicked extinguished? How often does their misfortune come upon them? How often does God apportion pain to them in his anger? ###### v18 How often are they like straw before the wind, and like chaff swept away by a whirlwind? ###### v19 You may say, 'God stores up a man's punishment for his children!' Instead let him repay the man himself so that he may be humbled! ###### v20 Let his own eyes see his destruction; let him drink of the anger of the Almighty. ###### v21 For what is his interest in his home after his death, when the number of his months has been broken off? ###### v22 Can anyone teach God knowledge, since he judges those that are on high?Death Levels Everything ###### v23 "One man dies in his full vigor, completely secure and prosperous, ###### v24 his body well nourished, and the marrow of his bones moist. ###### v25 And another man dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted anything good. ###### v26 Together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover over them both.Futile Words, Deceptive Answers ###### v27 "Yes, I know what you are thinking, the schemes by which you would wrong me. ###### v28 For you say, 'Where now is the nobleman's house, and where are the tents in which the wicked lived?' ###### v29 Have you never questioned those who travel the roads? Do you not recognize their accounts-- ###### v30 that the evil man is spared from the day of his misfortune, that he is delivered from the day of God's wrath? ###### v31 No one denounces his conduct to his face; no one repays him for what he has done. ###### v32 And when he is carried to the tombs, and watch is kept over the funeral mound, ###### v33 The clods of the torrent valley are sweet to him; behind him everybody follows in procession, and before him goes a countless throng. ###### v34 So how can you console me with your futile words? Nothing is left of your answers but deception!"
