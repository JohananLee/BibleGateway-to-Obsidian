###### 1 At this also my heart pounds and leaps from its place. ###### v2 Listen carefully to the thunder of his voice, to the rumbling that proceeds from his mouth. ###### v3 Under the whole heaven he lets it go, even his lightning to the far corners of the earth. ###### v4 After that a voice roars; he thunders with an exalted voice, and he does not hold back his lightning bolts when his voice is heard. ###### v5 God thunders with his voice in marvelous ways; he does great things beyond our understanding. ###### v6 For to the snow he says, 'Fall to earth,' and to the torrential rains, 'Pour down.' ###### v7 He causes everyone to stop working, so that all people may know his work. ###### v8 The wild animals go to their lairs, and in their dens they remain. ###### v9 A tempest blows out from its chamber, icy cold from the driving winds. ###### v10 The breath of God produces ice, and the breadth of the waters freeze solid. ###### v11 He loads the clouds with moisture; he scatters his lightning through the clouds. ###### v12 The clouds go round in circles, wheeling about according to his plans, to carry out all that he commands them over the face of the whole inhabited world. ###### v13 Whether it is for punishment, or for his land, or for mercy, he causes it to find its mark. ###### v14 "Pay attention to this, Job! Stand still and consider the wonders God works. ###### v15 Do you know how God commands them, how he makes lightning flash in his storm cloud? ###### v16 Do you know about the balancing of the clouds, that wondrous activity of him who is perfect in knowledge? ###### v17 You, whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind, ###### v18 will you, with him, spread out the clouds, solid as a mirror of molten metal? ###### v19 Tell us what we should say to him. We cannot prepare a case because of the darkness. ###### v20 Should he be informed that I want to speak? If a man speaks, surely he will be swallowed up! ###### v21 But now, the sun cannot be looked at-- it is bright in the skies-- after a wind passed and swept the clouds away. ###### v22 From the north he comes in golden splendor; around God is awesome majesty. ###### v23 As for the Almighty, we cannot attain to him! He is great in power, but justice and abundant righteousness he does not oppress. ###### v24 Therefore people fear him, for he does not regard all the wise in heart."
