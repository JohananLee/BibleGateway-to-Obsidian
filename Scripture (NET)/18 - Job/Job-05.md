###### 1 "Call now! Is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? ###### v2 For wrath kills the foolish person, and anger slays the silly one. ###### v3 I myself have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his place of residence. ###### v4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed at the place where judgment is rendered, nor is there anyone to deliver them. ###### v5 The hungry eat up his harvest, and take it even from behind the thorns, and the thirsty pant for their wealth. ###### v6 For evil does not come up from the dust, nor does trouble spring up from the ground, ###### v7 but people are born to trouble, as surely as the sparks fly upward.Blessings for the One Who Seeks God ###### v8 "But as for me, I would seek God, and to God I would set forth my case. ###### v9 He does great and unsearchable things, marvelous things without number; ###### v10 he gives rain on the earth, and sends water on the fields; ###### v11 he sets the lowly on high, that those who mourn are raised to safety. ###### v12 He frustrates the plans of the crafty so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had planned. ###### v13 He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the counsel of the cunning is brought to a quick end. ###### v14 They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope about in the noontime as if it were night. ###### v15 So he saves from the sword that comes from their mouth, even the poor from the hand of the powerful. ###### v16 Thus the poor have hope, and iniquity shuts its mouth. ###### v17 "Therefore, blessed is the man whom God corrects, so do not despise the discipline of the Almighty. ###### v18 For he wounds, but he also bandages; he strikes, but his hands also heal. ###### v19 He will deliver you from six calamities; yes, in seven no evil will touch you. ###### v20 In time of famine he will redeem you from death, and in time of war from the power of the sword. ###### v21 You will be protected from malicious gossip, and will not be afraid of the destruction when it comes. ###### v22 You will laugh at destruction and famine and need not be afraid of the beasts of the earth. ###### v23 For you will have a pact with the stones of the field, and the wild animals will be at peace with you. ###### v24 And you will know that your home will be secure, and when you inspect your domains, you will not be missing anything. ###### v25 You will also know that your children will be numerous, and your descendants like the grass of the earth. ###### v26 You will come to your grave in a full age, As stacks of grain are harvested in their season. ###### v27 Look, we have investigated this, so it is true. Hear it, and apply it for your own good."
