Bildad's Third Speech ###### 1 Then Bildad the Shuhite answered: ###### v2 "Dominion and awesome might belong to God; he establishes peace in his heights. ###### v3 Can his armies be numbered? On whom does his light not rise? ###### v4 How then can a human being be righteous before God? How can one born of a woman be pure? ###### v5 If even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned, ###### v6 how much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot-- a son of man, who is only a worm!"
