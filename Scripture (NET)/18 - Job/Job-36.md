Elihu's Fourth Speech ###### 1 Elihu said further: ###### v2 "Be patient with me a little longer and I will instruct you, for I still have words to speak on God's behalf. ###### v3 With my knowledge I will speak comprehensively, and to my Creator I will ascribe righteousness. ###### v4 For in truth, my words are not false; it is one complete in knowledge who is with you. ###### v5 Indeed, God is mighty; and he does not despise people, he is mighty, and firm in his intent. ###### v6 He does not allow the wicked to live, but he gives justice to the poor. ###### v7 He does not take his eyes off the righteous; but with kings on the throne he seats the righteous and exalts them forever. ###### v8 But if they are bound in chains, and held captive by the cords of affliction, ###### v9 then he reveals to them what they have done, and their transgressions, that they were behaving proudly. ###### v10 And he reveals this for correction, and says that they must turn from evil. ###### v11 If they obey and serve him, they live out their days in prosperity and their years in pleasantness. ###### v12 But if they refuse to listen, they pass over the river of death, and expire without knowledge. ###### v13 The godless at heart nourish anger, they do not cry out even when he binds them. ###### v14 They die in their youth, and their life ends among the male cultic prostitutes. ###### v15 He delivers the afflicted by their afflictions, he reveals himself to them by their suffering. ###### v16 And surely, he drew you from the mouth of distress, to a wide place, unrestricted, and to the comfort of your table filled with rich food. ###### v17 But now you are preoccupied with the judgment due the wicked, judgment and justice take hold of you. ###### v18 Be careful that no one entices you with riches; do not let a large bribe turn you aside. ###### v19 Would your wealth sustain you, so that you would not be in distress, even all your mighty efforts? ###### v20 Do not long for the cover of night to drag people away from their homes. ###### v21 Take heed, do not turn to evil, for because of this you have been tested by affliction. ###### v22 Indeed, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him? ###### v23 Who has prescribed his ways for him? Or said to him, 'You have done what is wicked'? ###### v24 Remember to extol his work, which people have praised in song. ###### v25 All humanity has seen it; people gaze on it from afar.The Work and Wisdom of God ###### v26 "Yes, God is great--beyond our knowledge! The number of his years is unsearchable. ###### v27 He draws up drops of water; they distill the rain into its mist, ###### v28 which the clouds pour down and shower on humankind abundantly. ###### v29 Who can understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion? ###### v30 See how he scattered his lightning about him; he has covered the depths of the sea. ###### v31 It is by these that he judges the nations and supplies food in abundance. ###### v32 With his hands he covers the lightning, and directs it against its target. ###### v33 His thunder announces the coming storm, the cattle also, concerning the storm's approach.
