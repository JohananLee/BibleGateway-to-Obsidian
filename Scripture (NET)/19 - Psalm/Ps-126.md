Psalm 126 ###### 1 When the LORD restored the well-being of Zion, we thought we were dreaming. ###### v2 At that time we laughed loudly and shouted for joy. At that time the nations said, "The LORD has accomplished great things for these people." ###### v3 The LORD did indeed accomplish great things for us. We were happy. ###### v4 O LORD, restore our well-being, just as the streams in the arid south are replenished. ###### v5 Those who shed tears as they plant will shout for joy when they reap the harvest. ###### v6 The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag of seed, will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain.
