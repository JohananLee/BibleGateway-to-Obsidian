Psalm 16 ###### 1 Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you. ###### v2 I say to the LORD, "You are the Lord, my only source of well-being." ###### v3 As for God's chosen people who are in the land, and the leading officials I admired so much-- ###### v4 their troubles multiply; they desire other gods. I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods, nor will I make vows in the name of their gods. ###### v5 LORD, you give me stability and prosperity; you make my future secure. ###### v6 It is as if I have been given fertile fields or received a beautiful tract of land. ###### v7 I will praise the LORD who guides me; yes, during the night I reflect and learn. ###### v8 I constantly trust in the LORD; because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. ###### v9 So my heart rejoices and I am happy; my life is safe. ###### v10 You will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit. ###### v11 You lead me in the path of life. I experience absolute joy in your presence; you always give me sheer delight.
