Psalm 43 ###### 1 Vindicate me, O God! Fight for me against an ungodly nation. Deliver me from deceitful and evil men. ###### v2 For you are the God who shelters me. Why do you reject me? Why must I walk around mourning because my enemies oppress me? ###### v3 Reveal your light and your faithfulness. They will lead me; they will escort me back to your holy hill, and to the place where you live. ###### v4 Then I will go to the altar of God, to the God who gives me ecstatic joy, so that I may express my thanks to you, O God, my God, with a harp. ###### v5 Why are you depressed, O my soul? Why are you upset? Wait for God! For I will again give thanks to my God for his saving intervention.
