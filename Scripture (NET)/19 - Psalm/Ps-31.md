Psalm 31 ###### 1 In you, O LORD, I have taken shelter. Never let me be humiliated. Vindicate me by rescuing me. ###### v2 Listen to me. Quickly deliver me. Be my protector and refuge, a stronghold where I can be safe. ###### v3 For you are my high ridge and my stronghold; for the sake of your own reputation you lead me and guide me. ###### v4 You will free me from the net they hid for me, for you are my place of refuge. ###### v5 Into your hand I entrust my life; you will rescue me, O LORD, the faithful God. ###### v6 I hate those who serve worthless idols, but I trust in the LORD. ###### v7 I will be happy and rejoice in your faithfulness, because you notice my pain and you are aware of how distressed I am. ###### v8 You do not deliver me over to the power of the enemy; you enable me to stand in a wide open place. ###### v9 Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am in distress! My eyes grow dim from suffering. I have lost my strength. ###### v10 For my life nears its end in pain; my years draw to a close as I groan. My strength fails me because of my sin, and my bones become brittle. ###### v11 Because of all my enemies, people disdain me; my neighbors are appalled by my suffering-- those who know me are horrified by my condition; those who see me in the street run away from me. ###### v12 I am forgotten, like a dead man no one thinks about; I am regarded as worthless, like a broken jar. ###### v13 For I hear what so many are saying, the terrifying news that comes from every direction. When they plot together against me, they figure out how they can take my life. ###### v14 But I trust in you, O LORD! I declare, "You are my God!" ###### v15 You determine my destiny. Rescue me from the power of my enemies and those who chase me. ###### v16 Smile on your servant. Deliver me because of your faithfulness. ###### v17 O LORD, do not let me be humiliated, for I call out to you. May evil men be humiliated. May they go wailing to the grave. ###### v18 May lying lips be silenced-- lips that speak defiantly against the innocent with arrogance and contempt. ###### v19 How great is your favor, which you store up for your loyal followers. In plain sight of everyone you bestow it on those who take shelter in you. ###### v20 You hide them with you, where they are safe from the attacks of men; you conceal them in a shelter, where they are safe from slanderous attacks. ###### v21 The LORD deserves praise for he demonstrated his amazing faithfulness to me when I was besieged by enemies. ###### v22 I jumped to conclusions and said, "I am cut off from your presence!" But you heard my plea for mercy when I cried out to you for help. ###### v23 Love the LORD, all you faithful followers of his! The LORD protects those who have integrity, but he pays back in full the one who acts arrogantly. ###### v24 Be strong and confident, all you who wait on the LORD.
