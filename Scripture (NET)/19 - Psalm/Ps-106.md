Psalm 106 ###### 1 Praise the LORD. Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, and his loyal love endures. ###### v2 Who can adequately recount the LORD's mighty acts, or relate all his praiseworthy deeds? ###### v3 How blessed are those who promote justice, and do what is right all the time. ###### v4 Remember me, O LORD, when you show favor to your people. Pay attention to me, when you deliver, ###### v5 so I may see the prosperity of your chosen ones, rejoice along with your nation, and boast along with the people who belong to you. ###### v6 We have sinned like our ancestors; we have done wrong, we have done evil. ###### v7 Our ancestors in Egypt failed to appreciate your miraculous deeds. They failed to remember your many acts of loyal love, and they rebelled at the sea, by the Red Sea. ###### v8 Yet he delivered them for the sake of his reputation, that he might reveal his power. ###### v9 He shouted at the Red Sea and it dried up; he led them through the deep water as if it were a desert. ###### v10 He delivered them from the power of the one who hated them, and rescued them from the power of the enemy. ###### v11 The water covered their enemies; not even one of them survived. ###### v12 They believed his promises; they sang praises to him. ###### v13 They quickly forgot what he had done; they did not wait for his instructions. ###### v14 In the wilderness they had an insatiable craving for meat; they challenged God in the wastelands. ###### v15 He granted their request, then struck them with a disease. ###### v16 In the camp they resented Moses, and Aaron, the LORD's holy priest. ###### v17 The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan; it engulfed the group led by Abiram. ###### v18 Fire burned their group; the flames scorched the wicked. ###### v19 They made an image of a calf at Horeb, and worshiped a metal idol. ###### v20 They traded their majestic God for the image of an ox that eats grass. ###### v21 They rejected the God who delivered them, the one who performed great deeds in Egypt, ###### v22 amazing feats in the land of Ham, mighty acts by the Red Sea. ###### v23 He threatened to destroy them, but Moses, his chosen one, interceded with him and turned back his destructive anger. ###### v24 They rejected the fruitful land; they did not believe his promise. ###### v25 They grumbled in their tents; they did not obey the LORD. ###### v26 So he made a solemn vow that he would make them die in the wilderness, ###### v27 make their descendants die among the nations, and scatter them among foreign lands. ###### v28 They worshiped Baal of Peor, and ate sacrifices offered to the dead. ###### v29 They made the LORD angry by their actions, and a plague broke out among them. ###### v30 Phinehas took a stand and intervened, and the plague subsided. ###### v31 This was credited to Phinehas as a righteous act for all generations to come. ###### v32 They made him angry by the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered because of them, ###### v33 for they aroused his temper, and he spoke rashly. ###### v34 They did not destroy the nations, as the LORD had commanded them to do. ###### v35 They mixed in with the nations and learned their ways. ###### v36 They worshiped their idols, which became a snare to them. ###### v37 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons. ###### v38 They shed innocent blood-- the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted by bloodshed. ###### v39 They were defiled by their deeds, and unfaithful in their actions. ###### v40 So the LORD was angry with his people and despised the people who belonged to him. ###### v41 He handed them over to the nations, and those who hated them ruled over them. ###### v42 Their enemies oppressed them; they were subject to their authority. ###### v43 Many times he delivered them, but they had a rebellious attitude, and degraded themselves by their sin. ###### v44 Yet he took notice of their distress, when he heard their cry for help. ###### v45 He remembered his covenant with them, and relented because of his great loyal love. ###### v46 He caused all their conquerors to have pity on them. ###### v47 Deliver us, O LORD, our God. Gather us from among the nations. Then we will give thanks to your holy name, and boast about your praiseworthy deeds. ###### v48 The LORD God of Israel deserves praise, in the future and forevermore. Let all the people say, "We agree! Praise the LORD!"
