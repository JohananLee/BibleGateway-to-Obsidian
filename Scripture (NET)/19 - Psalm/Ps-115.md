Psalm 115 ###### 1 Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your name bring honor, for the sake of your loyal love and faithfulness. ###### v2 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" ###### v3 Our God is in heaven. He does whatever he pleases. ###### v4 Their idols are made of silver and gold-- they are man-made. ###### v5 They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see, ###### v6 ears, but cannot hear, noses, but cannot smell, ###### v7 hands, but cannot touch, feet, but cannot walk. They cannot even clear their throats. ###### v8 Those who make them will end up like them, as will everyone who trusts in them. ###### v9 O Israel, trust in the LORD. He is their deliverer and protector. ###### v10 O family of Aaron, trust in the LORD. He is their deliverer and protector. ###### v11 You loyal followers of the LORD, trust in the LORD. He is their deliverer and protector. ###### v12 The LORD takes notice of us; he will bless-- he will bless the family of Israel, he will bless the family of Aaron. ###### v13 He will bless his loyal followers, both young and old. ###### v14 May he increase your numbers, yours and your children's. ###### v15 May you be blessed by the LORD, the Creator of heaven and earth. ###### v16 The heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth he has given to mankind. ###### v17 The dead do not praise the LORD, nor do any of those who descend into the silence of death. ###### v18 But we will praise the LORD now and forevermore. Praise the LORD!
