Psalm 26 ###### 1 Vindicate me, O LORD, for I have integrity, and I trust in the LORD without wavering. ###### v2 Examine me, O LORD, and test me. Evaluate my inner thoughts and motives. ###### v3 For I am ever aware of your faithfulness, and your loyalty continually motivates me. ###### v4 I do not associate with deceitful men, or consort with those who are dishonest. ###### v5 I hate the mob of evil men, and do not associate with the wicked. ###### v6 I maintain a pure lifestyle, so I can appear before your altar, O LORD, ###### v7 to give you thanks, and to tell about all your amazing deeds. ###### v8 O LORD, I love the temple where you live, the place where your splendor is revealed. ###### v9 Do not sweep me away with sinners, or execute me along with violent people, ###### v10 who are always ready to do wrong or offer a bribe. ###### v11 But I have integrity. Rescue me and have mercy on me! ###### v12 I am safe, and among the worshipers I will praise the LORD.
