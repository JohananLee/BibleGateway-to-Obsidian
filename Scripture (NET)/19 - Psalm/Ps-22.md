Psalm 22 ###### 1 My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? I groan in prayer, but help seems far away. ###### v2 My God, I cry out during the day, but you do not answer, and during the night my prayers do not let up. ###### v3 You are holy; you sit as king receiving the praises of Israel. ###### v4 In you our ancestors trusted; they trusted in you and you rescued them. ###### v5 To you they cried out, and they were saved; in you they trusted and they were not disappointed. ###### v6 But I am a worm, not a man; people insult me and despise me. ###### v7 All who see me taunt me; they mock me and shake their heads. ###### v8 They say, "Commit yourself to the LORD! Let the LORD rescue him! Let the LORD deliver him, for he delights in him." ###### v9 Yes, you are the one who brought me out from the womb and made me feel secure on my mother's breasts. ###### v10 I have been dependent on you since birth; from the time I came out of my mother's womb you have been my God. ###### v11 Do not remain far away from me, for trouble is near and I have no one to help me. ###### v12 Many bulls surround me; powerful bulls of Bashan hem me in. ###### v13 They open their mouths to devour me like a roaring lion that rips its prey. ###### v14 My strength drains away like water; all my bones are dislocated. My heart is like wax; it melts away inside me. ###### v15 The roof of my mouth is as dry as a piece of pottery; my tongue sticks to my gums. You set me in the dust of death. ###### v16 Yes, wild dogs surround me-- a gang of evil men crowd around me; like a lion they pin my hands and feet. ###### v17 I can count all my bones; my enemies are gloating over me in triumph. ###### v18 They are dividing up my clothes among themselves; they are rolling dice for my garments. ###### v19 But you, O LORD, do not remain far away. You are my source of strength. Hurry and help me! ###### v20 Deliver me from the sword. Save my life from the claws of the wild dogs. ###### v21 Rescue me from the mouth of the lion, and from the horns of the wild oxen. You have answered me. ###### v22 I will declare your name to my countrymen. In the middle of the assembly I will praise you. ###### v23 You loyal followers of the LORD, praise him. All you descendants of Jacob, honor him. All you descendants of Israel, stand in awe of him. ###### v24 For he did not despise or detest the suffering of the oppressed. He did not ignore him; when he cried out to him, he responded. ###### v25 You are the reason I offer praise in the great assembly; I will fulfill my promises before the LORD's loyal followers. ###### v26 Let the oppressed eat and be filled. Let those who seek his help praise the LORD. May you live forever! ###### v27 Let all the people of the earth acknowledge the LORD and turn to him. Let all the nations worship you. ###### v28 For the LORD is king and rules over the nations. ###### v29 All the thriving people of the earth will join the celebration and worship; all those who are descending into the grave will bow before him, including those who cannot preserve their lives. ###### v30 A whole generation will serve him; they will tell the next generation about the Lord. ###### v31 They will come and tell about his saving deeds; they will tell a future generation what he has accomplished.
