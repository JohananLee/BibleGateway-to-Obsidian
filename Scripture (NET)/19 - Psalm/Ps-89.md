Psalm 89 ###### 1 I will sing continually about the LORD's faithful deeds; to future generations I will proclaim your faithfulness. ###### v2 For I say, "Loyal love is permanently established; in the skies you set up your faithfulness." ###### v3 The LORD said, "I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have made a promise on oath to David, my servant: ###### v4 'I will give you an eternal dynasty and establish your throne throughout future generations.'" (Selah) ###### v5 O LORD, the heavens praise your amazing deeds, as well as your faithfulness in the angelic assembly. ###### v6 For who in the skies can compare to the LORD? Who is like the LORD among the heavenly beings, ###### v7 a God who is honored in the great angelic assembly, and more awesome than all who surround him? ###### v8 O LORD God of Heaven's Armies! Who is strong like you, O LORD? Your faithfulness surrounds you. ###### v9 You rule over the proud sea. When its waves surge, you calm them. ###### v10 You crushed the Proud One and killed it; with your strong arm you scattered your enemies. ###### v11 The heavens belong to you, as does the earth. You made the world and all it contains. ###### v12 You created the north and the south. Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name. ###### v13 Your arm is powerful, your hand strong, your right hand victorious. ###### v14 Equity and justice are the foundation of your throne. Loyal love and faithfulness characterize your rule. ###### v15 How blessed are the people who worship you! O LORD, they experience your favor. ###### v16 They rejoice in your name all day long, and are vindicated by your justice. ###### v17 For you give them splendor and strength. By your favor we are victorious. ###### v18 For our shield belongs to the LORD, our king to the Holy One of Israel. ###### v19 Then you spoke through a vision to your faithful followers and said: "I have placed a young hero over a warrior; I have raised up a young man from the people. ###### v20 I have discovered David, my servant. With my holy oil I have anointed him as king. ###### v21 My hand will support him, and my arm will strengthen him. ###### v22 No enemy will be able to exact tribute from him; a violent oppressor will not be able to humiliate him. ###### v23 I will crush his enemies before him; I will strike down those who hate him. ###### v24 He will experience my faithfulness and loyal love, and by my name he will win victories. ###### v25 I will place his hand over the sea, his right hand over the rivers. ###### v26 He will call out to me, 'You are my father, my God, and the protector who delivers me.' ###### v27 I will appoint him to be my firstborn son, the most exalted of the earth's kings. ###### v28 I will always extend my loyal love to him, and my covenant with him is secure. ###### v29 I will give him an eternal dynasty, and make his throne as enduring as the skies above. ###### v30 If his sons reject my law and disobey my regulations, ###### v31 if they break my rules and do not keep my commandments, ###### v32 I will punish their rebellion by beating them with a club, their sin by inflicting them with bruises. ###### v33 But I will not remove my loyal love from him, nor be unfaithful to my promise. ###### v34 I will not break my covenant or go back on what I promised. ###### v35 Once and for all I have vowed by my own holiness, I will never deceive David. ###### v36 His dynasty will last forever. His throne will endure before me, like the sun; ###### v37 it will remain stable, like the moon. His throne will endure like the skies." (Selah) ###### v38 But you have spurned and rejected him; you are angry with your chosen king. ###### v39 You have repudiated your covenant with your servant; you have thrown his crown to the ground. ###### v40 You have broken down all his walls; you have made his strongholds a heap of ruins. ###### v41 All who pass by have robbed him; he has become an object of disdain to his neighbors. ###### v42 You have allowed his adversaries to be victorious, and all his enemies to rejoice. ###### v43 You turn back his sword from the adversary, and have not sustained him in battle. ###### v44 You have brought to an end his splendor, and have knocked his throne to the ground. ###### v45 You have cut short his youth, and have covered him with shame. (Selah) ###### v46 How long, O LORD, will this last? Will you remain hidden forever? Will your anger continue to burn like fire? ###### v47 Take note of my brief lifespan. Why do you make all people so mortal? ###### v48 No man can live on without experiencing death, or deliver his life from the power of Sheol. (Selah) ###### v49 Where are your earlier faithful deeds, O Lord, the ones performed in accordance with your reliable oath to David? ###### v50 Take note, O Lord, of the way your servants are taunted, and of how I must bear so many insults from people. ###### v51 Your enemies, O LORD, hurl insults; they insult your chosen king as they dog his footsteps. ###### v52 The LORD deserves praise forevermore! We agree! We agree!
