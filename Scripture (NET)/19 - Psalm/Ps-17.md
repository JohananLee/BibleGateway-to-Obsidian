Psalm 17 ###### 1 LORD, consider my just cause. Pay attention to my cry for help. Listen to the prayer I sincerely offer. ###### v2 Make a just decision on my behalf. Decide what is right. ###### v3 You have scrutinized my inner motives; you have examined me during the night. You have carefully evaluated me, but you find no sin. I am determined I will say nothing sinful. ###### v4 As for the actions of people-- just as you have commanded, I have not followed in the footsteps of violent men. ###### v5 I carefully obey your commands; I do not deviate from them. ###### v6 I call to you because you will answer me, O God. Listen to me! Hear what I say! ###### v7 Accomplish awesome, faithful deeds, you who powerfully deliver those who look to you for protection from their enemies. ###### v8 Protect me as you would protect the pupil of your eye. Hide me in the shadow of your wings. ###### v9 Protect me from the wicked men who attack me, my enemies who crowd around me for the kill. ###### v10 They are calloused; they speak arrogantly. ###### v11 They attack me, now they surround me; they intend to throw me to the ground. ###### v12 He is like a lion that wants to tear its prey to bits, like a young lion crouching in hidden places. ###### v13 Rise up, LORD! Confront him. Knock him down. Use your sword to rescue me from the wicked man. ###### v14 LORD, use your power to deliver me from these murderers, from the murderers of this world. They enjoy prosperity; you overwhelm them with the riches they desire. They have many children, and leave their wealth to their offspring. ###### v15 As for me, because I am innocent I will see your face; when I awake you will reveal yourself to me.
