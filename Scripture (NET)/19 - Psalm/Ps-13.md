Psalm 13 ###### 1 How long, LORD, will you continue to ignore me? How long will you pay no attention to me? ###### v2 How long must I worry, and suffer in broad daylight? How long will my enemy gloat over me? ###### v3 Look at me! Answer me, O LORD my God! Revive me, or else I will die. ###### v4 Then my enemy will say, "I have defeated him." Then my foes will rejoice because I am shaken. ###### v5 But I trust in your faithfulness. May I rejoice because of your deliverance. ###### v6 I will sing praises to the LORD when he vindicates me.
