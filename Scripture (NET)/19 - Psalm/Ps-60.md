Psalm 60 ###### 1 O God, you have rejected us. You suddenly turned on us in your anger. Please restore us! ###### v2 You made the earth quake; you split it open. Repair its breaches, for it is ready to fall. ###### v3 You have made your people experience hard times; you have made us drink intoxicating wine. ###### v4 You have given your loyal followers a rallying flag, so that they might seek safety from the bow. (Selah) ###### v5 Deliver by your power and answer me, so that the ones you love may be safe. ###### v6 God has spoken in his sanctuary: "I will triumph. I will parcel out Shechem; the Valley of Sukkoth I will measure off. ###### v7 Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh. Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my royal scepter. ###### v8 Moab is my washbasin. I will make Edom serve me. I will shout in triumph over Philistia." ###### v9 Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will bring me to Edom? ###### v10 Have you not rejected us, O God? O God, you do not go into battle with our armies. ###### v11 Give us help against the enemy, for any help men might offer is futile. ###### v12 By God's power we will conquer; he will trample down our enemies.
