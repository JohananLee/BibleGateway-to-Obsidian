Psalm 94 ###### 1 O LORD, the God who avenges! O God who avenges, reveal your splendor. ###### v2 Rise up, O judge of the earth. Pay back the proud. ###### v3 O LORD, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked celebrate? ###### v4 They spew out threats and speak defiantly; all the evildoers boast. ###### v5 O LORD, they crush your people; they oppress the nation that belongs to you. ###### v6 They kill the widow and the resident foreigner, and they murder the fatherless. ###### v7 Then they say, "The LORD does not see this; the God of Jacob does not take notice of it." ###### v8 Take notice of this, you ignorant people. You fools, when will you ever understand? ###### v9 Does the one who makes the human ear not hear? Does the one who forms the human eye not see? ###### v10 Does the one who disciplines the nations not punish? He is the one who imparts knowledge to human beings! ###### v11 The LORD knows that peoples' thoughts are morally bankrupt. ###### v12 How blessed is the one whom you instruct, O LORD, the one whom you teach from your law, ###### v13 in order to protect him from times of trouble, until the wicked are destroyed. ###### v14 Certainly the LORD does not forsake his people; he does not abandon the nation that belongs to him. ###### v15 For justice will prevail, and all the morally upright will be vindicated. ###### v16 Who will rise up to defend me against the wicked? Who will stand up for me against the evildoers? ###### v17 If the LORD had not helped me, I would soon have dwelt in the silence of death. ###### v18 If I say, "My foot is slipping," your loyal love, O LORD, supports me. ###### v19 When worries threaten to overwhelm me, your soothing touch makes me happy. ###### v20 Cruel rulers are not your allies, those who make oppressive laws. ###### v21 They conspire against the blameless, and condemn to death the innocent. ###### v22 But the LORD will protect me, and my God will shelter me. ###### v23 He will pay them back for their sin. He will destroy them because of their evil; the LORD our God will destroy them.
