Psalm 1 ###### 1 How blessed is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked, or stand in the pathway with sinners, or sit in the assembly of scoffers. ###### v2 Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the LORD's commands; he meditates on his commands day and night. ###### v3 He is like a tree planted by flowing streams; it yields its fruit at the proper time, and its leaves never fall off. He succeeds in everything he attempts. ###### v4 Not so with the wicked! Instead they are like wind-driven chaff. ###### v5 For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment, nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly. ###### v6 Certainly the LORD guards the way of the godly, but the way of the wicked ends in destruction.
