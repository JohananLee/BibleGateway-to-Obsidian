Psalm 92 ###### 1 It is fitting to thank the LORD, and to sing praises to your name, O Most High. ###### v2 It is fitting to proclaim your loyal love in the morning, and your faithfulness during the night, ###### v3 to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument and a lyre, to the accompaniment of the meditative tone of the harp. ###### v4 For you, O LORD, have made me happy by your work. I will sing for joy because of what you have done. ###### v5 How great are your works, O LORD! Your plans are very intricate! ###### v6 The spiritually insensitive do not recognize this; the fool does not understand this. ###### v7 When the wicked sprout up like grass, and all the evildoers glisten, it is so that they may be annihilated. ###### v8 But you, O LORD, reign forever. ###### v9 Indeed, look at your enemies, O LORD. Indeed, look at how your enemies perish. All the evildoers are scattered. ###### v10 You exalt my horn like that of a wild ox. I am covered with fresh oil. ###### v11 I gloat in triumph over those who tried to ambush me; I hear the defeated cries of the evil foes who attacked me. ###### v12 The godly grow like a palm tree; they grow high like a cedar in Lebanon. ###### v13 Planted in the LORD's house, they grow in the courts of our God. ###### v14 They bear fruit even when they are old; they are filled with vitality and have many leaves. ###### v15 So they proclaim that the LORD, my Protector, is just and never unfair.
