Psalm 57 ###### 1 Have mercy on me, O God. Have mercy on me. For in you I have taken shelter. In the shadow of your wings I take shelter until trouble passes. ###### v2 I cry out for help to God Most High, to the God who vindicates me. ###### v3 May he send help from heaven and deliver me from my enemies who hurl insults. (Selah) May God send his loyal love and faithfulness. ###### v4 I am surrounded by lions; I lie down among those who want to devour me, men whose teeth are spears and arrows, whose tongues are sharp swords. ###### v5 Rise up above the sky, O God. May your splendor cover the whole earth. ###### v6 They have prepared a net to trap me; I am discouraged. They have dug a pit for me. They will fall into it. (Selah) ###### v7 I am determined, O God. I am determined. I will sing and praise you. ###### v8 Awake, my soul! Awake, O stringed instrument and harp! I will wake up at dawn. ###### v9 I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord. I will sing praises to you before foreigners. ###### v10 For your loyal love extends beyond the sky, and your faithfulness reaches the clouds. ###### v11 Rise up above the sky, O God. May your splendor cover the whole earth.
