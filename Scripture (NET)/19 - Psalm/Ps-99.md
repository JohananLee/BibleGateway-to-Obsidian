Psalm 99 ###### 1 The LORD reigns! The nations tremble. He sits enthroned above the cherubim; the earth shakes. ###### v2 The LORD is elevated in Zion; he is exalted over all the nations. ###### v3 Let them praise your great and awesome name. He is holy! ###### v4 The king is strong; he loves justice. You ensure that legal decisions will be made fairly; you promote justice and equity in Jacob. ###### v5 Praise the LORD our God. Worship before his footstool. He is holy! ###### v6 Moses and Aaron were among his priests; Samuel was one of those who prayed to him. They prayed to the LORD and he answered them. ###### v7 He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud; they obeyed his regulations and the ordinance he gave them. ###### v8 O LORD our God, you answered them. They found you to be a forgiving God, but also one who punished their sinful deeds. ###### v9 Praise the LORD our God! Worship on his holy hill, for the LORD our God is holy.
