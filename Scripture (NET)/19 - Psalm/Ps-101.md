Psalm 101 ###### 1 I will sing about loyalty and justice. To you, O LORD, I will sing praises. ###### v2 I will walk in the way of integrity. When will you come to me? I will conduct my business with integrity in the midst of my palace. ###### v3 I will not even consider doing what is dishonest. I hate doing evil; I will have no part of it. ###### v4 I will have nothing to do with a perverse person; I will not permit evil. ###### v5 I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret. I will not tolerate anyone who has a haughty demeanor and an arrogant attitude. ###### v6 I will favor the honest people of the land, and allow them to live with me. Those who walk in the way of integrity will attend me. ###### v7 Deceitful people will not live in my palace. Liars will not be welcome in my presence. ###### v8 Each morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land, and remove all evildoers from the city of the LORD.
