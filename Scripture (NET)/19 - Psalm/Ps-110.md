Psalm 110 ###### 1 Here is the LORD's proclamation to my lord: "Sit down at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool." ###### v2 The LORD extends your dominion from Zion. Rule in the midst of your enemies. ###### v3 Your people willingly follow you when you go into battle. On the holy hills at sunrise the dew of your youth belongs to you. ###### v4 The LORD makes this promise on oath and will not revoke it: "You are an eternal priest after the pattern of Melchizedek." ###### v5 O Lord, at your right hand he strikes down kings in the day he unleashes his anger. ###### v6 He executes judgment against the nations. He fills the valleys with corpses; he shatters their heads over the vast battlefield. ###### v7 From the stream along the road he drinks; then he lifts up his head.
