Psalm 120 ###### 1 In my distress I cried out to the LORD and he answered me. ###### v2 I said, "O LORD, rescue me from those who lie with their lips and those who deceive with their tongues. ###### v3 How will he severely punish you, you deceptive talker? ###### v4 Here's how! With the sharp arrows of warriors, with arrowheads forged over the hot coals. ###### v5 How miserable I am. For I have lived temporarily in Meshech; I have resided among the tents of Kedar. ###### v6 For too long I have had to reside with those who hate peace. ###### v7 I am committed to peace, but when I speak, they want to make war.
