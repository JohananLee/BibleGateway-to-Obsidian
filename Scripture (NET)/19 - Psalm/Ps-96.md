Psalm 96 ###### 1 Sing to the LORD a new song. Sing to the LORD, all the earth. ###### v2 Sing to the LORD. Praise his name. Announce every day how he delivers. ###### v3 Tell the nations about his splendor. Tell all the nations about his amazing deeds. ###### v4 For the LORD is great and certainly worthy of praise; he is more awesome than all gods. ###### v5 For all the gods of the nations are worthless, but the LORD made the sky. ###### v6 Majestic splendor emanates from him; his sanctuary is firmly established and beautiful. ###### v7 Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD splendor and strength. ###### v8 Ascribe to the LORD the splendor he deserves. Bring an offering and enter his courts. ###### v9 Worship the LORD in holy attire. Tremble before him, all the earth. ###### v10 Say among the nations, "The LORD reigns! The world is established; it cannot be moved. He judges the nations fairly." ###### v11 Let the sky rejoice, and the earth be happy. Let the sea and everything in it shout. ###### v12 Let the fields and everything in them celebrate. Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy ###### v13 before the LORD, for he comes. For he comes to judge the earth. He judges the world fairly, and the nations in accordance with his justice.
