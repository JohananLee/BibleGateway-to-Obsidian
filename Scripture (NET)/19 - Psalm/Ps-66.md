Psalm 66 ###### 1 Shout out praise to God, all the earth! ###### v2 Sing praises about the majesty of his reputation. Give him the honor he deserves! ###### v3 Say to God: "How awesome are your deeds! Because of your great power your enemies cower in fear before you. ###### v4 All the earth worships you and sings praises to you. They sing praises to your name." (Selah) ###### v5 Come and witness God's exploits! His acts on behalf of people are awesome. ###### v6 He turned the sea into dry land; they passed through the river on foot. Let us rejoice in him there. ###### v7 He rules by his power forever; he watches the nations. Stubborn rebels should not exalt themselves. (Selah) ###### v8 Praise our God, you nations. Loudly proclaim his praise. ###### v9 He preserves our lives and does not allow our feet to slip. ###### v10 For you, O God, tested us; you purified us like refined silver. ###### v11 You led us into a trap; you caused us to suffer. ###### v12 You allowed men to ride over our heads; we passed through fire and water, but you brought us out into a wide open place. ###### v13 I will enter your temple with burnt sacrifices; I will fulfill the vows I made to you, ###### v14 which my lips uttered and my mouth spoke when I was in trouble. ###### v15 I will offer up to you fattened animals as burnt sacrifices, along with the smell of sacrificial rams. I will offer cattle and goats. (Selah) ###### v16 Come! Listen, all you who are loyal to God. I will declare what he has done for me. ###### v17 I cried out to him for help and praised him with my tongue. ###### v18 If I had harbored sin in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. ###### v19 However, God heard; he listened to my prayer. ###### v20 God deserves praise, for he did not reject my prayer or abandon his love for me.
