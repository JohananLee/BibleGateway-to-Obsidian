Psalm 127 ###### 1 If the LORD does not build a house, then those who build it work in vain. If the LORD does not guard a city, then the watchman stands guard in vain. ###### v2 It is vain for you to rise early, come home late, and work so hard for your food. Yes, he provides for those whom he loves even when they sleep. ###### v3 Yes, sons are a gift from the LORD; the fruit of the womb is a reward. ###### v4 Sons born during one's youth are like arrows in a warrior's hand. ###### v5 How blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them. They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate.
