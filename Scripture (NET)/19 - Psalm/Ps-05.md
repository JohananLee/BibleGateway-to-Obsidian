Psalm 5 ###### 1 Listen to what I say, LORD! Carefully consider my complaint! ###### v2 Pay attention to my cry for help, my King and my God, for I am praying to you! ###### v3 LORD, in the morning you will hear me; in the morning I will present my case to you and then wait expectantly for an answer. ###### v4 Certainly you are not a God who approves of evil; evil people cannot dwell with you. ###### v5 Arrogant people cannot stand in your presence; you hate all who behave wickedly. ###### v6 You destroy liars; the LORD despises violent and deceitful people. ###### v7 But as for me, because of your great faithfulness I will enter your house; I will bow down toward your holy temple as I worship you. ###### v8 LORD, lead me in your righteousness because of those who wait to ambush me, remove the obstacles in the way in which you are guiding me. ###### v9 For they do not speak the truth; their stomachs are like the place of destruction, their throats like an open grave, their tongues like a steep slope leading into it. ###### v10 Condemn them, O God! May their own schemes be their downfall. Drive them away because of their many acts of insurrection, for they have rebelled against you. ###### v11 But may all who take shelter in you be happy. May they continually shout for joy. Shelter them so that those who are loyal to you may rejoice. ###### v12 Certainly you reward the godly, LORD. Like a shield you protect them in your good favor.
