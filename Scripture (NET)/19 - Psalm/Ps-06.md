Psalm 6 ###### 1 LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger. Do not discipline me in your raging fury. ###### v2 Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am frail. Heal me, LORD, for my bones are shaking. ###### v3 I am absolutely terrified, and you, LORD--how long will this continue? ###### v4 Relent, LORD, rescue me! Deliver me because of your faithfulness. ###### v5 For no one remembers you in the realm of death. In Sheol who gives you thanks? ###### v6 I am exhausted as I groan. All night long I drench my bed in tears; my tears saturate the cushion beneath me. ###### v7 My eyes grow dim from suffering; they grow weak because of all my enemies. ###### v8 Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly, for the LORD has heard the sound of my weeping. ###### v9 The LORD has heard my appeal for mercy; the LORD has accepted my prayer. ###### v10 They will be humiliated and absolutely terrified. All my enemies will turn back and be suddenly humiliated.
