Psalm 78 ###### 1 Pay attention, my people, to my instruction. Listen to the words I speak. ###### v2 I will sing a song that imparts wisdom; I will make insightful observations about the past. ###### v3 What we have heard and learned-- that which our ancestors have told us-- ###### v4 we will not hide from their descendants. We will tell the next generation about the LORD's praiseworthy acts, about his strength and the amazing things he has done. ###### v5 He established a rule in Jacob; he set up a law in Israel. He commanded our ancestors to make his deeds known to their descendants, ###### v6 so that the next generation, children yet to be born, might know about them. They will grow up and tell their descendants about them. ###### v7 Then they will place their confidence in God. They will not forget the works of God, and they will obey his commands. ###### v8 Then they will not be like their ancestors, who were a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that was not committed and faithful to God. ###### v9 The Ephraimites were armed with bows, but they retreated in the day of battle. ###### v10 They did not keep their covenant with God, and they refused to obey his law. ###### v11 They forgot what he had done, the amazing things he had shown them. ###### v12 He did amazing things in the sight of their ancestors, in the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan. ###### v13 He divided the sea and led them across it; he made the water stand in a heap. ###### v14 He led them with a cloud by day, and with the light of a fire all night long. ###### v15 He broke open rocks in the wilderness, and gave them enough water to fill the depths of the sea. ###### v16 He caused streams to flow from the rock, and made the water flow like rivers. ###### v17 Yet they continued to sin against him, and rebelled against the Most High in the desert. ###### v18 They willfully challenged God by asking for food to satisfy their appetite. ###### v19 They insulted God, saying, "Is God really able to give us food in the wilderness? ###### v20 Yes, he struck a rock and water flowed out; streams gushed forth. But can he also give us food? Will he provide meat for his people?" ###### v21 When the LORD heard this, he was furious. A fire broke out against Jacob, and his anger flared up against Israel, ###### v22 because they did not have faith in God, and did not trust his ability to deliver them. ###### v23 He gave a command to the clouds above, and opened the doors in the sky. ###### v24 He rained down manna for them to eat; he gave them the grain of heaven. ###### v25 Man ate the food of the mighty ones. He sent them more than enough to eat. ###### v26 He brought the east wind through the sky, and by his strength led forth the south wind. ###### v27 He rained down meat on them like dust, birds as numerous as the sand on the seashores. ###### v28 He caused them to fall right in the middle of their camp, all around their homes. ###### v29 They ate until they were beyond full; he gave them what they desired. ###### v30 They were not yet filled up; their food was still in their mouths, ###### v31 when the anger of God flared up against them. He killed some of the strongest of them; he brought the young men of Israel to their knees. ###### v32 Despite all this, they continued to sin, and did not trust him to do amazing things. ###### v33 So he caused them to die unsatisfied and filled with terror. ###### v34 When he struck them down, they sought his favor; they turned back and longed for God. ###### v35 They remembered that God was their protector, and that God Most High was their deliverer. ###### v36 But they deceived him with their words, and lied to him. ###### v37 They were not really committed to him, and they were unfaithful to his covenant. ###### v38 Yet he is compassionate. He forgives sin and does not destroy. He often holds back his anger, and does not stir up his fury. ###### v39 He remembered that they were made of flesh, and were like a wind that blows past and does not return. ###### v40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness, and insulted him in the wastelands. ###### v41 They again challenged God, and offended the Holy One of Israel. ###### v42 They did not remember what he had done, how he delivered them from the enemy, ###### v43 when he performed his awesome deeds in Egypt, and his acts of judgment in the region of Zoan. ###### v44 He turned their rivers into blood, and they could not drink from their streams. ###### v45 He sent swarms of biting insects against them, as well as frogs that overran their land. ###### v46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper, the fruit of their labor to the locust. ###### v47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycamore-fig trees with driving rain. ###### v48 He rained hail down on their cattle, and hurled lightning bolts down on their livestock. ###### v49 His raging anger lashed out against them. He sent fury, rage, and trouble as messengers who bring disaster. ###### v50 He sent his anger in full force. He did not spare them from death; he handed their lives over to destruction. ###### v51 He struck down all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their reproductive power in the tents of Ham. ###### v52 Yet he brought out his people like sheep; he led them through the wilderness like a flock. ###### v53 He guided them safely along, and they were not afraid; but the sea covered their enemies. ###### v54 He brought them to the border of his holy land, to this mountainous land that his right hand acquired. ###### v55 He drove the nations out from before them; he assigned them their tribal allotments and allowed the tribes of Israel to settle down. ###### v56 Yet they challenged and defied God Most High, and did not obey his commands. ###### v57 They were unfaithful and acted as treacherously as their ancestors; they were as unreliable as a malfunctioning bow. ###### v58 They made him angry with their pagan shrines, and made him jealous with their idols. ###### v59 God heard and was angry; he completely rejected Israel. ###### v60 He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh, the tent where he lived among men. ###### v61 He allowed the symbol of his strong presence to be captured; he gave the symbol of his splendor into the hand of the enemy. ###### v62 He delivered his people over to the sword, and was angry with his chosen nation. ###### v63 Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins remained unmarried. ###### v64 Their priests fell by the sword, but their widows did not weep. ###### v65 But then the Lord awoke from his sleep; he was like a warrior in a drunken rage. ###### v66 He drove his enemies back; he made them a permanent target for insults. ###### v67 He rejected the tent of Joseph; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim. ###### v68 He chose the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion, which he loves. ###### v69 He made his sanctuary as enduring as the heavens above, as secure as the earth, which he established permanently. ###### v70 He chose David, his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds. ###### v71 He took him away from following the mother sheep, and made him the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and of Israel, his chosen nation. ###### v72 David cared for them with pure motives; he led them with skill.
