Psalm 56 ###### 1 Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me. All day long hostile enemies are tormenting me. ###### v2 Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long. Indeed, many are fighting against me, O Exalted One. ###### v3 When I am afraid, I trust in you. ###### v4 In God--I boast in his promise-- in God I trust; I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me? ###### v5 All day long they cause me trouble; they make a habit of plotting my demise. ###### v6 They stalk and lurk; they watch my every step, as they prepare to take my life. ###### v7 Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape. In your anger bring down the nations, O God. ###### v8 You keep track of my misery. Put my tears in your leather container. Are they not recorded in your scroll? ###### v9 My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help; I know that God is on my side. ###### v10 In God--I boast in his promise-- in the LORD--I boast in his promise-- ###### v11 in God I trust; I am not afraid. What can mere men do to me? ###### v12 I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God; I will give you the thank offerings you deserve, ###### v13 when you deliver my life from death. You keep my feet from stumbling, so that I might serve God as I enjoy life.
