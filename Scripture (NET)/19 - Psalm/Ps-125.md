Psalm 125 ###### 1 Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved and will endure forever. ###### v2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, now and forevermore. ###### v3 Indeed, the scepter of a wicked king will not settle upon the allotted land of the godly. Otherwise the godly might do what is wrong. ###### v4 Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, to the morally upright. ###### v5 As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path, may the LORD remove them, along with those who behave wickedly. May Israel experience peace.
