Psalm 105 ###### 1 Give thanks to the LORD. Call on his name. Make known his accomplishments among the nations. ###### v2 Sing to him. Make music to him. Tell about all his miraculous deeds. ###### v3 Boast about his holy name. Let the hearts of those who seek the LORD rejoice. ###### v4 Seek the LORD and the strength he gives. Seek his presence continually. ###### v5 Recall the miraculous deeds he performed, his mighty acts and the judgments he decreed, ###### v6 O children of Abraham, God's servant, you descendants of Jacob, God's chosen ones. ###### v7 He is the LORD our God; he carries out judgment throughout the earth. ###### v8 He always remembers his covenantal decree, the promise he made to a thousand generations-- ###### v9 the promise he made to Abraham, the promise he made by oath to Isaac. ###### v10 He gave it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as a lasting promise, ###### v11 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as the portion of your inheritance." ###### v12 When they were few in number, just a very few, and resident foreigners within it, ###### v13 they wandered from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another. ###### v14 He let no one oppress them; he disciplined kings for their sake, ###### v15 saying, "Don't touch my chosen ones. Don't harm my prophets." ###### v16 He called down a famine upon the earth; he cut off all the food supply. ###### v17 He sent a man ahead of them-- Joseph was sold as a servant. ###### v18 The shackles hurt his feet; his neck was placed in an iron collar, ###### v19 until the time when his prediction came true. The LORD's word proved him right. ###### v20 The king authorized his release; the ruler of nations set him free. ###### v21 He put him in charge of his palace, and made him manager of all his property, ###### v22 giving him authority to imprison his officials and to teach his advisers. ###### v23 Israel moved to Egypt; Jacob lived for a time in the land of Ham. ###### v24 The LORD made his people very fruitful, and made them more numerous than their enemies. ###### v25 He caused the Egyptians to hate his people, and to mistreat his servants. ###### v26 He sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. ###### v27 They executed his miraculous signs among them, and his amazing deeds in the land of Ham. ###### v28 He made it dark; Moses and Aaron did not disobey his orders. ###### v29 He turned the Egyptians' water into blood, and killed their fish. ###### v30 Their land was overrun by frogs, which even got into the rooms of their kings. ###### v31 He ordered flies to come; gnats invaded their whole territory. ###### v32 He sent hail along with the rain; there was lightning in their land. ###### v33 He destroyed their vines and fig trees, and broke the trees throughout their territory. ###### v34 He ordered locusts to come, innumerable grasshoppers. ###### v35 They ate all the vegetation in their land, and devoured the crops of their fields. ###### v36 He struck down all the firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of their reproductive power. ###### v37 He brought his people out enriched with silver and gold; none of his tribes stumbled. ###### v38 Egypt was happy when they left, for they were afraid of them. ###### v39 He spread out a cloud for a cover, and provided a fire to light up the night. ###### v40 They asked for food, and he sent quail; he satisfied them with food from the sky. ###### v41 He opened up a rock and water flowed out; a river ran through dry regions. ###### v42 Yes, he remembered the sacred promise he made to Abraham his servant. ###### v43 When he led his people out, they rejoiced; his chosen ones shouted with joy. ###### v44 He handed the territory of nations over to them, and they took possession of what other peoples had produced, ###### v45 so that they might keep his commands and obey his laws. Praise the LORD.
