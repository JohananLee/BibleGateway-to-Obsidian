Psalm 121 ###### 1 I look up toward the hills. From where does my help come? ###### v2 My help comes from the LORD, the Creator of heaven and earth. ###### v3 May he not allow your foot to slip. May your Protector not sleep. ###### v4 Look! Israel's Protector does not sleep or slumber. ###### v5 The LORD is your protector; the LORD is the shade at your right hand. ###### v6 The sun will not harm you by day, or the moon by night. ###### v7 The LORD will protect you from all harm; he will protect your life. ###### v8 The LORD will protect you in all you do, now and forevermore.
