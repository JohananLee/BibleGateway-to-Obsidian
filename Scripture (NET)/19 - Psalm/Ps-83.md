Psalm 83 ###### 1 O God, do not be silent. Do not ignore us. Do not be inactive, O God. ###### v2 For look, your enemies are making a commotion; those who hate you are hostile. ###### v3 They carefully plot against your people, and make plans to harm the ones you cherish. ###### v4 They say, "Come on, let's annihilate them so they are no longer a nation. Then the name of Israel will be remembered no more." ###### v5 Yes, they devise a unified strategy; they form an alliance against you. ###### v6 It includes the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites, ###### v7 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, Philistia and the inhabitants of Tyre. ###### v8 Even Assyria has allied with them, lending its strength to the descendants of Lot. (Selah) ###### v9 Do to them as you did to Midian-- as you did to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River. ###### v10 They were destroyed at Endor; their corpses were like manure on the ground. ###### v11 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their rulers like Zebah and Zalmunna, ###### v12 who said, "Let's take over the pastures of God." ###### v13 O my God, make them like dead thistles, like dead weeds blown away by the wind. ###### v14 Like the fire that burns down the forest, or the flames that consume the mountainsides, ###### v15 chase them with your gale winds, and terrify them with your windstorm. ###### v16 Cover their faces with shame, so they might seek you, O LORD. ###### v17 May they be humiliated and continually terrified. May they die in shame. ###### v18 Then they will know that you alone are the LORD, the Most High over all the earth.
