Psalm 51 ###### 1 Have mercy on me, O God, because of your loyal love. Because of your great compassion, wipe away my rebellious acts. ###### v2 Wash away my wrongdoing. Cleanse me of my sin. ###### v3 For I am aware of my rebellious acts; I am forever conscious of my sin. ###### v4 Against you--you above all--I have sinned; I have done what is evil in your sight. So you are just when you confront me; you are right when you condemn me. ###### v5 Look, I was guilty of sin from birth, a sinner the moment my mother conceived me. ###### v6 Look, you desire integrity in the inner man; you want me to possess wisdom. ###### v7 Cleanse me with hyssop and I will be pure; wash me and I will be whiter than snow. ###### v8 Grant me the ultimate joy of being forgiven. May the bones you crushed rejoice. ###### v9 Hide your face from my sins. Wipe away all my guilt. ###### v10 Create for me a pure heart, O God. Renew a resolute spirit within me. ###### v11 Do not reject me. Do not take your holy Spirit away from me. ###### v12 Let me again experience the joy of your deliverance. Sustain me by giving me the desire to obey. ###### v13 Then I will teach rebels your merciful ways, and sinners will turn to you. ###### v14 Rescue me from the guilt of murder, O God, the God who delivers me. Then my tongue will shout for joy because of your righteousness. ###### v15 O Lord, give me the words. Then my mouth will praise you. ###### v16 Certainly you do not want a sacrifice, or else I would offer it; you do not desire a burnt sacrifice. ###### v17 The sacrifice God desires is a humble spirit-- O God, a humble and repentant heart you will not reject. ###### v18 Because you favor Zion, do what is good for her. Fortify the walls of Jerusalem. ###### v19 Then you will accept the proper sacrifices, burnt sacrifices and whole offerings; then bulls will be sacrificed on your altar.
