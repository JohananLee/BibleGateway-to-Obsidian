Psalm 141 ###### 1 O LORD, I cry out to you. Come quickly to me. Pay attention to me when I cry out to you. ###### v2 May you accept my prayer like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering. ###### v3 O LORD, place a guard on my mouth. Protect the opening of my lips. ###### v4 Do not let me have evil desires, or participate in sinful activities with men who behave wickedly. I will not eat their delicacies. ###### v5 May the godly strike me in love and correct me. May my head not refuse choice oil. Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds. ###### v6 They will be thrown over the side of a cliff by their judges. They will listen to my words, for they are pleasant. ###### v7 As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol. ###### v8 Surely I am looking to you, O Sovereign LORD. In you I take shelter. Do not expose me to danger. ###### v9 Protect me from the snare they have laid for me, and the traps the evildoers have set. ###### v10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I escape.
