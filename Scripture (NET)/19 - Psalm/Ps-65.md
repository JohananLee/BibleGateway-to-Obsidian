Psalm 65 ###### 1 Praise awaits you, O God, in Zion. Vows made to you are fulfilled. ###### v2 You hear prayers; all people approach you. ###### v3 Our record of sins overwhelms me, but you forgive our acts of rebellion. ###### v4 How blessed is the one whom you choose, and allow to live in your palace courts. May we be satisfied with the good things of your house-- your holy palace. ###### v5 You answer our prayers by performing awesome acts of deliverance, O God, our savior. All the ends of the earth trust in you, as well as those living across the wide seas. ###### v6 You created the mountains by your power, and demonstrated your strength. ###### v7 You calmed the raging seas and their roaring waves, as well as the commotion made by the nations. ###### v8 Even those living in the remotest areas are awestruck by your acts; you cause those living in the east and west to praise you. ###### v9 You visit the earth and give it rain; you make it rich and fertile. God's streams are full of water; you provide grain for the people of the earth, for you have prepared the earth in this way. ###### v10 You saturate its furrows, and soak its plowed ground. With rain showers you soften its soil, and make its crops grow. ###### v11 You crown the year with your good blessings, and you leave abundance in your wake. ###### v12 The pastures in the wilderness glisten with moisture, and the hills are clothed with joy. ###### v13 The meadows are clothed with sheep, and the valleys are covered with grain. They shout joyfully, yes, they sing.
