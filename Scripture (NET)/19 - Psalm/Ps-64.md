Psalm 64 ###### 1 Listen to me, O God, as I offer my lament! Protect my life from the enemy's terrifying attacks. ###### v2 Hide me from the plots of evil men, from the crowd of evildoers. ###### v3 They sharpen their tongues like swords; they aim their arrows, a slanderous charge, ###### v4 in order to shoot down the innocent in secluded places. They shoot at him suddenly and are unafraid of retaliation. ###### v5 They encourage one another to carry out their evil deed. They plan how to hide snares, and boast, "Who will see them?" ###### v6 They devise unjust schemes; they disguise a well-conceived plot. Man's inner thoughts cannot be discovered. ###### v7 But God will shoot at them; suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow. ###### v8 Their slander will bring about their demise. All who see them will shudder, ###### v9 and all people will fear. They will proclaim what God has done, and reflect on his deeds. ###### v10 The godly will rejoice in the LORD and take shelter in him. All the morally upright will boast.
