Psalm 30 ###### 1 I will praise you, O LORD, for you lifted me up, and did not allow my enemies to gloat over me. ###### v2 O LORD my God, I cried out to you and you healed me. ###### v3 O LORD, you pulled me up from Sheol; you rescued me from among those descending into the grave. ###### v4 Sing to the LORD, you faithful followers of his; give thanks to his holy name. ###### v5 For his anger lasts only a brief moment, and his good favor restores one's life. One may experience sorrow during the night, but joy arrives in the morning. ###### v6 In my self-confidence I said, "I will never be shaken." ###### v7 O LORD, in your good favor you made me secure. Then you rejected me and I was terrified. ###### v8 To you, O LORD, I cried out; I begged the Lord for mercy: ###### v9 "What profit is there in taking my life, in my descending into the Pit? Can the dust of the grave praise you? Can it declare your loyalty? ###### v10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy on me. O LORD, deliver me." ###### v11 Then you turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and covered me with joy. ###### v12 So now my heart will sing to you and not be silent; O LORD my God, I will always give thanks to you.
