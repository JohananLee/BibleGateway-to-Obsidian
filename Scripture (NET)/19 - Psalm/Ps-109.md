Psalm 109 ###### 1 O God whom I praise, do not ignore me. ###### v2 For they say cruel and deceptive things to me; they lie to me. ###### v3 They surround me and say hateful things; they attack me for no reason. ###### v4 They repay my love with accusations, but I continue to pray. ###### v5 They repay me evil for good, and hate for love. ###### v6 Appoint an evil man to testify against him. May an accuser stand at his right side. ###### v7 When he is judged, he will be found guilty. Then his prayer will be regarded as sinful. ###### v8 May his days be few. May another take his job. ###### v9 May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. ###### v10 May his children roam around begging, asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home. ###### v11 May the creditor seize all he owns. May strangers loot his property. ###### v12 May no one show him kindness. May no one have compassion on his fatherless children. ###### v13 May his descendants be cut off. May the memory of them be wiped out by the time the next generation arrives. ###### v14 May his ancestors' sins be remembered by the LORD. May his mother's sin not be forgotten. ###### v15 May the LORD be constantly aware of them, and cut off the memory of his children from the earth. ###### v16 For he never bothered to show kindness; he harassed the oppressed and needy, and killed the disheartened. ###### v17 He loved to curse others, so those curses have come upon him. He had no desire to bless anyone, so he has experienced no blessings. ###### v18 He made cursing a way of life, so curses poured into his stomach like water and seeped into his bones like oil. ###### v19 May a curse attach itself to him, like a garment one puts on, or a belt one wears continually. ###### v20 May the LORD repay my accusers in this way, those who say evil things about me. ###### v21 O Sovereign LORD, intervene on my behalf for the sake of your reputation. Because your loyal love is good, deliver me. ###### v22 For I am oppressed and needy, and my heart beats violently within me. ###### v23 I am fading away like a shadow at the end of the day; I am shaken off like a locust. ###### v24 I am so starved my knees shake; I have turned into skin and bones. ###### v25 I am disdained by them. When they see me, they shake their heads. ###### v26 Help me, O LORD my God. Because you are faithful to me, deliver me. ###### v27 Then they will realize this is your work, and that you, LORD, have accomplished it. ###### v28 They curse, but you will bless. When they attack, they will be humiliated, but your servant will rejoice. ###### v29 My accusers will be covered with shame, and draped in humiliation as if it were a robe. ###### v30 I will thank the LORD profusely. In the middle of a crowd I will praise him, ###### v31 because he stands at the right hand of the needy, to deliver him from those who threaten his life.
