Psalm 118 ###### 1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, and his loyal love endures. ###### v2 Let Israel say, "Yes, his loyal love endures." ###### v3 Let the family of Aaron say, "Yes, his loyal love endures." ###### v4 Let the loyal followers of the LORD say, "Yes, his loyal love endures." ###### v5 In my distress I cried out to the LORD. The LORD answered me and put me in a wide open place. ###### v6 The LORD is on my side; I am not afraid. What can people do to me? ###### v7 The LORD is on my side as my helper. I look in triumph on those who hate me. ###### v8 It is better to take shelter in the LORD than to trust in people. ###### v9 It is better to take shelter in the LORD than to trust in princes. ###### v10 All the nations surrounded me. Indeed, in the name of the LORD I pushed them away. ###### v11 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me. Indeed, in the name of the LORD I pushed them away. ###### v12 They surrounded me like bees. But they disappeared as quickly as a fire among thorns. Indeed, in the name of the LORD I pushed them away. ###### v13 "You aggressively attacked me and tried to knock me down, but the LORD helped me. ###### v14 The LORD gives me strength and protects me; he has become my deliverer." ###### v15 They celebrate deliverance in the tents of the godly. The LORD's right hand conquers. ###### v16 The LORD's right hand gives victory; the LORD's right hand conquers. ###### v17 I will not die, but live, and I will proclaim what the LORD has done. ###### v18 The LORD severely punished me, but he did not hand me over to death. ###### v19 Open for me the gates of the just king's temple. I will enter through them and give thanks to the LORD. ###### v20 This is the LORD's gate-- the godly enter through it. ###### v21 I will give you thanks, for you answered me, and have become my deliverer. ###### v22 The stone that the builders discarded has become the cornerstone. ###### v23 This is the LORD's work. We consider it amazing! ###### v24 This is the day the LORD has brought about. We will be happy and rejoice in it. ###### v25 Please, LORD, deliver! Please, LORD, grant us success! ###### v26 May the one who comes in the name of the LORD be blessed. We will pronounce blessings on you in the LORD's temple. ###### v27 The LORD is God, and he has delivered us. Tie the offering with ropes to the horns of the altar. ###### v28 You are my God, and I will give you thanks. You are my God and I will praise you. ###### v29 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good and his loyal love endures.
