Psalm 133 ###### 1 Look! How good and how pleasant it is when brothers truly live in unity. ###### v2 It is like fine oil poured on the head, which flows down the beard-- Aaron's beard, and then flows down his garments. ###### v3 It is like the dew of Hermon, which flows down upon the hills of Zion. Indeed, that is where the LORD has decreed a blessing will be available--eternal life.
