Psalm 23 ###### 1 The LORD is my shepherd, I lack nothing. ###### v2 He takes me to lush pastures, he leads me to refreshing water. ###### v3 He restores my strength. He leads me down the right paths for the sake of his reputation. ###### v4 Even when I must walk through the darkest valley, I fear no danger, for you are with me; your rod and your staff reassure me. ###### v5 You prepare a feast before me in plain sight of my enemies. You refresh my head with oil; my cup is completely full. ###### v6 Surely your goodness and faithfulness will pursue me all my days, and I will live in the LORD's house for the rest of my life.
