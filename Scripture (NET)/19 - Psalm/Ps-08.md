Psalm 8 ###### 1 O LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your reputation throughout the earth! You reveal your majesty in the heavens above. ###### v2 From the mouths of children and nursing babies you have ordained praise on account of your adversaries, so that you might put an end to the vindictive enemy. ###### v3 When I look up at the heavens, which your fingers made, and see the moon and the stars, which you set in place, ###### v4 Of what importance is the human race, that you should notice them? Of what importance is mankind, that you should pay attention to them? ###### v5 You made them a little less than the heavenly beings. You crowned mankind with honor and majesty. ###### v6 you appoint them to rule over your creation; you have placed everything under their authority, ###### v7 including all the sheep and cattle, as well as the wild animals, ###### v8 the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, and everything that moves through the currents of the seas. ###### v9 O LORD, our Lord, how magnificent is your reputation throughout the earth!
