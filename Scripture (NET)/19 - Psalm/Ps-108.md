Psalm 108 ###### 1 I am determined, O God. I will sing and praise you with my whole heart. ###### v2 Awake, O stringed instrument and harp. I will wake up at dawn. ###### v3 I will give you thanks before the nations, O LORD. I will sing praises to you before foreigners. ###### v4 For your loyal love extends beyond the sky, and your faithfulness reaches the clouds. ###### v5 Rise up above the sky, O God. May your splendor cover the whole earth. ###### v6 Deliver by your power and answer me, so that the ones you love may be safe. ###### v7 God has spoken in his sanctuary: "I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem; the Valley of Sukkoth I will measure off. ###### v8 Gilead belongs to me, as does Manasseh. Ephraim is my helmet, Judah my royal scepter. ###### v9 Moab is my washbasin. I will make Edom serve me. I will shout in triumph over Philistia." ###### v10 Who will lead me into the fortified city? Who will bring me to Edom? ###### v11 Have you not rejected us, O God? O God, you do not go into battle with our armies. ###### v12 Give us help against the enemy, for any help men might offer is futile. ###### v13 By God's power we will conquer; he will trample down our enemies.
