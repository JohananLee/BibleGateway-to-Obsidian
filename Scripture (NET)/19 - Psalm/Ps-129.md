Psalm 129 ###### 1 "Since my youth they have often attacked me," let Israel say. ###### v2 "Since my youth they have often attacked me, but they have not defeated me. ###### v3 The plowers plowed my back; they made their furrows long. ###### v4 The LORD is just; he cut the ropes of the wicked." ###### v5 May all who hate Zion be humiliated and turned back. ###### v6 May they be like the grass on the rooftops, which withers before one can even pull it up, ###### v7 which cannot fill the reaper's hand, or the lap of the one who gathers the grain. ###### v8 Those who pass by will not say, "May you experience the LORD's blessing! We pronounce a blessing on you in the name of the LORD."
