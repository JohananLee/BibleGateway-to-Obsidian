Psalm 116 ###### 1 I love the LORD because he heard my plea for mercy, ###### v2 and listened to me. As long as I live, I will call to him when I need help. ###### v3 The ropes of death tightened around me, the snares of Sheol confronted me. I was confronted with trouble and sorrow. ###### v4 I called on the name of the LORD, "Please, LORD, rescue my life!" ###### v5 The LORD is merciful and fair; our God is compassionate. ###### v6 The LORD protects the untrained; I was in serious trouble and he delivered me. ###### v7 Rest once more, my soul, for the LORD has vindicated you. ###### v8 Yes, LORD, you rescued my life from death, kept my eyes from tears and my feet from stumbling. ###### v9 I will serve the LORD in the land of the living. ###### v10 I had faith when I said, "I am severely oppressed." ###### v11 I rashly declared, "All men are liars." ###### v12 How can I repay the LORD for all his acts of kindness to me? ###### v13 I will celebrate my deliverance, and call on the name of the LORD. ###### v14 I will fulfill my vows to the LORD before all his people. ###### v15 The LORD values the lives of his faithful followers. ###### v16 Yes, LORD! I am indeed your servant; I am your servant, the son of your female servant. You saved me from death. ###### v17 I will present a thank offering to you, and call on the name of the LORD. ###### v18 I will fulfill my vows to the LORD before all his people, ###### v19 in the courts of the LORD's temple, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Praise the LORD!
