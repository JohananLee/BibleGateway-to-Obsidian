Psalm 63 ###### 1 O God, you are my God. I long for you. My soul thirsts for you, my flesh yearns for you, in a dry and parched land where there is no water. ###### v2 Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you, and witnessed your power and splendor. ###### v3 Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself, my lips will praise you. ###### v4 For this reason I will praise you while I live; in your name I will lift up my hands. ###### v5 As with choice meat you satisfy my soul. My mouth joyfully praises you, ###### v6 whenever I remember you on my bed, and think about you during the nighttime hours. ###### v7 For you are my deliverer; under your wings I rejoice. ###### v8 My soul pursues you; your right hand upholds me. ###### v9 Enemies seek to destroy my life, but they will descend into the depths of the earth. ###### v10 Each one will be handed over to the sword; their corpses will be eaten by jackals. ###### v11 But the king will rejoice in God; everyone who takes oaths in his name will boast, for the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.
