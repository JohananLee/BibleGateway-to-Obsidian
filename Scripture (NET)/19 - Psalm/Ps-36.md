Psalm 36 ###### 1 An evil man is rebellious to the core. He does not fear God, ###### v2 for he is too proud to recognize and give up his sin. ###### v3 The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful; he does not care about doing what is wise and right. ###### v4 While he lies in bed he plans ways to sin. He is committed to a sinful lifestyle; he does not reject what is evil. ###### v5 O LORD, your loyal love reaches to the sky, your faithfulness to the clouds. ###### v6 Your justice is like the highest mountains, your fairness like the deepest sea; you, LORD, preserve mankind and the animal kingdom. ###### v7 How precious is your loyal love, O God! The human race finds shelter under your wings. ###### v8 They are filled with food from your house, and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies. ###### v9 For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light. ###### v10 Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers, and vindicate the morally upright. ###### v11 Do not let arrogant men overtake me, or let evil men make me homeless. ###### v12 I can see the evildoers! They have fallen. They have been knocked down and are unable to get up.
