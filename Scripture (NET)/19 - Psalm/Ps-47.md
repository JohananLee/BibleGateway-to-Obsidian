Psalm 47 ###### 1 All you nations, clap your hands. Shout out to God in celebration. ###### v2 For the LORD Most High is awe-inspiring; he is the great king who rules the whole earth! ###### v3 He subdued nations beneath us and countries under our feet. ###### v4 He picked out for us a special land to be a source of pride for Jacob, whom he loves. (Selah) ###### v5 God has ascended his throne amid loud shouts; the LORD has ascended amid the blaring of ram's horns. ###### v6 Sing to God! Sing! Sing to our king! Sing! ###### v7 For God is king of the whole earth. Sing a well-written song. ###### v8 God reigns over the nations. God sits on his holy throne. ###### v9 The nobles of the nations assemble, along with the people of the God of Abraham, for God has authority over the rulers of the earth. He is highly exalted.
