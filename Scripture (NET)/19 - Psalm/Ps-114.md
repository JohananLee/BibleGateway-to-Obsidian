Psalm 114 ###### 1 When Israel left Egypt, when the family of Jacob left a foreign nation behind, ###### v2 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his kingdom. ###### v3 The sea looked and fled; the Jordan River turned back. ###### v4 The mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs. ###### v5 Why do you flee, O sea? Why do you turn back, O Jordan River? ###### v6 Why do you skip like rams, O mountains, like lambs, O hills? ###### v7 Tremble, O earth, before the Lord-- before the God of Jacob, ###### v8 who turned a rock into a pool of water, a hard rock into springs of water.
