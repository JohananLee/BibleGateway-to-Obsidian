Psalm 50 ###### 1 El, God, the LORD has spoken, and summoned the earth to come from the east and west. ###### v2 From Zion, the most beautiful of all places, God has come in splendor. ###### v3 "May our God come and not be silent." Consuming fire goes ahead of him, and all around him a storm rages. ###### v4 He summons the heavens above, as well as the earth, so that he might judge his people. ###### v5 He says: "Assemble my covenant people before me, those who ratified a covenant with me by sacrifice." ###### v6 The heavens declare his fairness, for God is judge. (Selah) ###### v7 He says: "Listen, my people. I am speaking! Listen, Israel. I am accusing you. I am God, your God! ###### v8 I am not condemning you because of your sacrifices, or because of your burnt sacrifices that you continually offer me. ###### v9 I do not need to take a bull from your household or goats from your sheepfolds. ###### v10 For every wild animal in the forest belongs to me, as well as the cattle that graze on a thousand hills. ###### v11 I keep track of every bird in the hills, and the insects of the field are mine. ###### v12 Even if I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and all it contains belong to me. ###### v13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls? Do I drink the blood of goats? ###### v14 Present to God a thank offering. Repay your vows to the Most High. ###### v15 Pray to me when you are in trouble. I will deliver you, and you will honor me." ###### v16 God says this to the evildoer: "How can you declare my commands, and talk about my covenant? ###### v17 For you hate instruction and reject my words. ###### v18 When you see a thief, you join him; you associate with men who are unfaithful to their wives. ###### v19 You do damage with words, and use your tongue to deceive. ###### v20 You plot against your brother; you slander your own brother. ###### v21 When you did these things, I was silent, so you thought I was exactly like you. But now I will condemn you and state my case against you. ###### v22 Carefully consider this, you who reject God. Otherwise I will rip you to shreds and no one will be able to rescue you. ###### v23 Whoever presents a thank offering honors me. To whoever obeys my commands, I will reveal my power to deliver."
