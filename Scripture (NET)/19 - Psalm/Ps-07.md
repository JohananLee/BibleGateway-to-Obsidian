Psalm 7 ###### 1 O LORD my God, in you I have taken shelter. Deliver me from all who chase me. Rescue me! ###### v2 Otherwise they will rip me to shreds like a lion; they will tear me to bits and no one will be able to rescue me. ###### v3 O LORD my God, if I have done what they say, or am guilty of unjust actions, ###### v4 or have wronged my ally, or helped his lawless enemy, ###### v5 may an enemy relentlessly chase me and catch me; may he trample me to death and leave me lying dishonored in the dust. (Selah) ###### v6 Stand up angrily, LORD. Rise up with raging fury against my enemies. Wake up for my sake, and execute the judgment you have decreed for them. ###### v7 The countries are assembled all around you; take once more your rightful place over them. ###### v8 The LORD judges the nations. Vindicate me, LORD, because I am innocent, because I am blameless, O Exalted One. ###### v9 May the evil deeds of the wicked come to an end. But make the innocent secure, O righteous God, you who examine inner thoughts and motives. ###### v10 The Exalted God is my shield, the one who delivers the morally upright. ###### v11 God is a just judge; he is angry throughout the day. ###### v12 If a person does not repent, God will wield his sword. He has prepared to shoot his bow. ###### v13 He has prepared deadly weapons to use against him; he gets ready to shoot flaming arrows. ###### v14 See the one who is pregnant with wickedness, who conceives destructive plans, and gives birth to harmful lies-- ###### v15 he digs a pit and then falls into the hole he has made. ###### v16 He becomes the victim of his own destructive plans-- and the violence he intended for others falls on his own head. ###### v17 I will thank the LORD for his justice; I will sing praises to the LORD Most High!
