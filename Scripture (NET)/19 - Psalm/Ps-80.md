Psalm 80 ###### 1 O Shepherd of Israel, pay attention, you who lead Joseph like a flock of sheep. You who sit enthroned above the cherubim, reveal your splendor. ###### v2 In the sight of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh reveal your power. Come and deliver us. ###### v3 O God, restore us. Smile on us. Then we will be delivered. ###### v4 O LORD God of Heaven's Armies, how long will you remain angry at your people while they pray to you? ###### v5 You have given them tears as food; you have made them drink tears by the measure. ###### v6 You have made our neighbors dislike us, and our enemies insult us. ###### v7 O God of Heaven's Armies, restore us. Smile on us. Then we will be delivered. ###### v8 You uprooted a vine from Egypt; you drove out nations and transplanted it. ###### v9 You cleared the ground for it; it took root, and filled the land. ###### v10 The mountains were covered by its shadow, the highest cedars by its branches. ###### v11 Its branches reached the Mediterranean Sea, and its shoots the Euphrates River. ###### v12 Why did you break down its walls, so that all who pass by pluck its fruit? ###### v13 The wild boars of the forest ruin it; the insects of the field feed on it. ###### v14 O God of Heaven's Armies, come back. Look down from heaven and take notice. Take care of this vine, ###### v15 the root your right hand planted, the shoot you made to grow. ###### v16 It is burned and cut down. May those who did this die because you are displeased with them. ###### v17 May you give support to the one you have chosen, to the one whom you raised up for yourself. ###### v18 Then we will not turn away from you. Revive us and we will pray to you. ###### v19 O LORD God of Heaven's Armies, restore us. Smile on us. Then we will be delivered.
