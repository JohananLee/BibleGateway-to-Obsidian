Psalm 18 ###### 1 He said: "I love you, LORD, my source of strength! ###### v2 The LORD is my high ridge, my stronghold, my deliverer. My God is my rocky summit where I take shelter, my shield, the horn that saves me, and my refuge. ###### v3 I called to the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and I was delivered from my enemies. ###### v4 The waves of death engulfed me, the currents of chaos overwhelmed me. ###### v5 The ropes of Sheol tightened around me, the snares of death trapped me. ###### v6 In my distress I called to the LORD; I cried out to my God. From his heavenly temple he heard my voice; he listened to my cry for help. ###### v7 The earth heaved and shook. The roots of the mountains trembled; they heaved because he was angry. ###### v8 Smoke ascended from his nose; fire devoured as it came from his mouth. He hurled down fiery coals. ###### v9 He made the sky sink as he descended; a thick cloud was under his feet. ###### v10 He mounted a winged angel and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind. ###### v11 He shrouded himself in darkness, in thick rain clouds. ###### v12 From the brightness in front of him came hail and fiery coals. ###### v13 The LORD thundered in the sky; the Most High shouted. ###### v14 He shot his arrows and scattered them, many lightning bolts and routed them. ###### v15 The depths of the sea were exposed; the inner regions of the world were uncovered by your battle cry, LORD, by the powerful breath from your nose. ###### v16 He reached down from above and took hold of me; he pulled me from the surging water. ###### v17 He rescued me from my strong enemy, from those who hate me, for they were too strong for me. ###### v18 They confronted me in my day of calamity, but the LORD helped me. ###### v19 He brought me out into a wide open place; he delivered me because he was pleased with me. ###### v20 The LORD repaid me for my godly deeds; he rewarded my blameless behavior. ###### v21 For I have obeyed the LORD's commands; I have not rebelled against my God. ###### v22 For I am aware of all his regulations, and I do not reject his rules. ###### v23 I was innocent before him, and kept myself from sinning. ###### v24 The LORD rewarded me for my godly deeds; he took notice of my blameless behavior. ###### v25 You prove to be loyal to one who is faithful; you prove to be trustworthy to one who is innocent. ###### v26 You prove to be reliable to one who is blameless, but you prove to be deceptive to one who is perverse. ###### v27 For you deliver oppressed people, but you bring down those who have a proud look. ###### v28 Indeed, you light my lamp, LORD. My God illuminates the darkness around me. ###### v29 Indeed, with your help I can charge against an army; by my God's power I can jump over a wall. ###### v30 The one true God acts in a faithful manner; the LORD's promise is reliable. He is a shield to all who take shelter in him. ###### v31 Indeed, who is God besides the LORD? Who is a protector besides our God? ###### v32 The one true God gives me strength; he removes the obstacles in my way. ###### v33 He gives me the agility of a deer; he enables me to negotiate the rugged terrain. ###### v34 He trains my hands for battle; my arms can bend even the strongest bow. ###### v35 You give me your protective shield; your right hand supports me. Your willingness to help enables me to prevail. ###### v36 You widen my path; my feet do not slip. ###### v37 I chase my enemies and catch them; I do not turn back until I wipe them out. ###### v38 I beat them to death; they fall at my feet. ###### v39 You give me strength for battle; you make my foes kneel before me. ###### v40 You make my enemies retreat; I destroy those who hate me. ###### v41 They cry out, but there is no one to help them; they cry out to the LORD, but he does not answer them. ###### v42 I grind them as fine windblown dust; I beat them underfoot like clay in the streets. ###### v43 You rescue me from a hostile army. You make me a leader of nations; people over whom I had no authority are now my subjects. ###### v44 When they hear of my exploits, they submit to me. Foreigners are powerless before me. ###### v45 Foreigners lose their courage; they shake with fear as they leave their strongholds. ###### v46 The LORD is alive! My Protector is praiseworthy. The God who delivers me is exalted as king. ###### v47 The one true God completely vindicates me; he makes nations submit to me. ###### v48 He delivers me from my enemies. You snatch me away from those who attack me; you rescue me from violent men. ###### v49 So I will give you thanks before the nations, O LORD. I will sing praises to you. ###### v50 He gives his king magnificent victories; he is faithful to his chosen ruler, to David and his descendants forever."
