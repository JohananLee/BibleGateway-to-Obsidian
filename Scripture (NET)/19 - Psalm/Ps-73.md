Psalm 73 ###### 1 Certainly God is good to Israel, and to those whose motives are pure. ###### v2 But as for me, my feet almost slipped; my feet almost slid out from under me. ###### v3 For I envied those who are proud, as I observed the prosperity of the wicked. ###### v4 For they suffer no pain; their bodies are strong and well fed. ###### v5 They are immune to the trouble common to men; they do not suffer as other men do. ###### v6 Arrogance is their necklace, and violence covers them like clothing. ###### v7 Their prosperity causes them to do wrong; their thoughts are sinful. ###### v8 They mock and say evil things; they proudly threaten violence. ###### v9 They speak as if they rule in heaven, and lay claim to the earth. ###### v10 Therefore they have more than enough food to eat, and even suck up the water of the sea. ###### v11 They say, "How does God know what we do? Is the Most High aware of what goes on?" ###### v12 Take a good look. This is what the wicked are like, those who always have it so easy and get richer and richer. ###### v13 I concluded, "Surely in vain I have kept my motives pure and maintained a pure lifestyle. ###### v14 I suffer all day long, and am punished every morning." ###### v15 If I had publicized these thoughts, I would have betrayed your people. ###### v16 When I tried to make sense of this, it was troubling to me. ###### v17 Then I entered the precincts of God's temple, and understood the destiny of the wicked. ###### v18 Surely you put them in slippery places; you bring them down to ruin. ###### v19 How desolate they become in a mere moment. Terrifying judgments make their demise complete. ###### v20 They are like a dream after one wakes up. O Lord, when you awake you will despise them. ###### v21 Yes, my spirit was bitter, and my insides felt sharp pain. ###### v22 I was ignorant and lacked insight; I was as senseless as an animal before you. ###### v23 But I am continually with you; you hold my right hand. ###### v24 You guide me by your wise advice, and then you will lead me to a position of honor. ###### v25 Whom do I have in heaven but you? On earth there is no one I desire but you. ###### v26 My flesh and my heart may grow weak, but God always protects my heart and gives me stability. ###### v27 Yes, look! Those far from you die; you destroy everyone who is unfaithful to you. ###### v28 But as for me, God's presence is all I need. I have made the Sovereign LORD my shelter, as I declare all the things you have done.
