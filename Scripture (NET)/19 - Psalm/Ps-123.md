Psalm 123 ###### 1 I look up toward you, the one enthroned in heaven. ###### v2 Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes will look to the LORD, our God, until he shows us favor. ###### v3 Show us favor, O LORD, show us favor! For we have had our fill of humiliation, and then some. ###### v4 We have had our fill of the taunts of the self-assured, of the contempt of the proud.
