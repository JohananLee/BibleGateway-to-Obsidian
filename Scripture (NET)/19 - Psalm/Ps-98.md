Psalm 98 ###### 1 Sing to the LORD a new song, for he performs amazing deeds. His right hand and his mighty arm accomplish deliverance. ###### v2 The LORD demonstrates his power to deliver; in the sight of the nations he reveals his justice. ###### v3 He remains loyal and faithful to the family of Israel. All the ends of the earth see our God deliver us. ###### v4 Shout out praises to the LORD, all the earth. Break out in a joyful shout and sing! ###### v5 Sing to the LORD accompanied by a harp, accompanied by a harp and the sound of music. ###### v6 With trumpets and the blaring of the ram's horn, shout out praises before the king, the LORD. ###### v7 Let the sea and everything in it shout, along with the world and those who live in it. ###### v8 Let the rivers clap their hands! Let the mountains sing in unison ###### v9 before the LORD. For he comes to judge the earth. He judges the world fairly, and the nations in a just manner.
