Psalm 41 ###### 1 How blessed is the one who treats the poor properly. When trouble comes, may the LORD deliver him. ###### v2 May the LORD protect him and save his life. May he be blessed in the land. Do not turn him over to his enemies. ###### v3 The LORD supports him on his sickbed; you have healed him from his illness. ###### v4 As for me, I said: "O LORD, have mercy on me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you. ###### v5 My enemies ask this cruel question about me, 'When will he finally die and be forgotten?' ###### v6 When someone comes to visit, he pretends to be friendly; he thinks of ways to defame me, and when he leaves he slanders me. ###### v7 All who hate me whisper insults about me to one another; they plan ways to harm me. ###### v8 They say, 'An awful disease overwhelms him, and now that he is bedridden he will never recover.' ###### v9 Even my close friend whom I trusted, he who shared meals with me, has turned against me. ###### v10 As for you, O LORD, have mercy on me and raise me up, so I can pay them back!" ###### v11 By this I know that you are pleased with me, for my enemy does not triumph over me. ###### v12 As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity; you allow me permanent access to your presence. ###### v13 The LORD God of Israel deserves praise in the future and forevermore. We agree! We agree!
