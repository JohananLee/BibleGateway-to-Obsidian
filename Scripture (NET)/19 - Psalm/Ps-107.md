Psalm 107 ###### 1 Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, and his loyal love endures. ###### v2 Let those delivered by the LORD speak out, those whom he delivered from the power of the enemy, ###### v3 and gathered from foreign lands, from east and west, from north and south. ###### v4 They wandered through the wilderness, in a wasteland; they found no road to a city in which to live. ###### v5 They were hungry and thirsty; they fainted from exhaustion. ###### v6 They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. ###### v7 He led them on a level road, that they might find a city in which to live. ###### v8 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people. ###### v9 For he has satisfied those who thirst, and those who hunger he has filled with food. ###### v10 They sat in utter darkness, bound in painful iron chains, ###### v11 because they had rebelled against God's commands, and rejected the instructions of the Most High. ###### v12 So he used suffering to humble them; they stumbled and no one helped them up. ###### v13 They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. ###### v14 He brought them out of the utter darkness, and tore off their shackles. ###### v15 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people. ###### v16 For he shattered the bronze gates, and hacked through the iron bars. ###### v17 They acted like fools in their rebellious ways, and suffered because of their sins. ###### v18 They lost their appetite for all food, and they drew near the gates of death. ###### v19 They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. ###### v20 He sent them an assuring word and healed them; he rescued them from the pits where they were trapped. ###### v21 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people. ###### v22 Let them present thank offerings, and loudly proclaim what he has done. ###### v23 Some traveled on the sea in ships, and carried cargo over the vast waters. ###### v24 They witnessed the acts of the LORD, his amazing feats on the deep water. ###### v25 He gave the order for a windstorm, and it stirred up the waves of the sea. ###### v26 They reached up to the sky, then dropped into the depths. The sailors' strength left them because the danger was so great. ###### v27 They swayed and staggered like drunks, and all their skill proved ineffective. ###### v28 They cried out to the LORD in their distress; he delivered them from their troubles. ###### v29 He calmed the storm, and the waves grew silent. ###### v30 The sailors rejoiced because the waves grew quiet, and he led them to the harbor they desired. ###### v31 Let them give thanks to the LORD for his loyal love, and for the amazing things he has done for people. ###### v32 Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people. Let them praise him in the place where the leaders preside. ###### v33 He turned streams into a desert, springs of water into arid land, ###### v34 and a fruitful land into a barren place, because of the sin of its inhabitants. ###### v35 As for his people, he turned a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land into springs of water. ###### v36 He allowed the hungry to settle there, and they established a city in which to live. ###### v37 They cultivated fields, and planted vineyards, which yielded a harvest of fruit. ###### v38 He blessed them so that they became very numerous. He would not allow their cattle to decrease in number. ###### v39 As for their enemies, they decreased in number and were beaten down, because of painful distress and suffering. ###### v40 He would pour contempt upon princes, and he made them wander in a wasteland with no road. ###### v41 Yet he protected the needy from oppression, and cared for his families like a flock of sheep. ###### v42 When the godly see this, they rejoice, and every sinner shuts his mouth. ###### v43 Whoever is wise, let him take note of these things. Let them consider the LORD's acts of loyal love.
