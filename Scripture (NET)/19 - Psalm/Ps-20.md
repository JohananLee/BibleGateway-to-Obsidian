Psalm 20 ###### 1 May the LORD answer you when you are in trouble; may the God of Jacob make you secure. ###### v2 May he send you help from his temple; from Zion may he give you support. ###### v3 May he take notice of all your offerings; may he accept your burnt sacrifice. (Selah) ###### v4 May he grant your heart's desire; may he bring all your plans to pass. ###### v5 Then we will shout for joy over your victory; we will rejoice in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your requests. ###### v6 Now I am sure that the LORD will deliver his chosen king; he will intervene for him from his holy, heavenly temple, and display his mighty ability to deliver. ###### v7 Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we depend on the LORD our God. ###### v8 They will fall down, but we will stand firm. ###### v9 The LORD will deliver the king; he will answer us when we call to him for help!
