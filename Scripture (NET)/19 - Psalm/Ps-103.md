Psalm 103 ###### 1 Praise the LORD, O my soul. With all that is within me, praise his holy name. ###### v2 Praise the LORD, O my soul. Do not forget all his kind deeds. ###### v3 He is the one who forgives all your sins, who heals all your diseases, ###### v4 who delivers your life from the Pit, who crowns you with his loyal love and compassion, ###### v5 who satisfies your life with good things, so your youth is renewed like an eagle's. ###### v6 The LORD does what is fair, and executes justice for all the oppressed. ###### v7 The LORD revealed his faithful acts to Moses, his deeds to the Israelites. ###### v8 The LORD is compassionate and merciful; he is patient and demonstrates great loyal love. ###### v9 He does not always accuse, and does not stay angry. ###### v10 He does not deal with us as our sins deserve; he does not repay us as our misdeeds deserve. ###### v11 For as the skies are high above the earth, so his loyal love towers over his faithful followers. ###### v12 As far as the eastern horizon is from the west, so he removes the guilt of our rebellious actions from us. ###### v13 As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on his faithful followers. ###### v14 For he knows what we are made of; he realizes we are made of clay. ###### v15 A person's life is like grass. Like a flower in the field it flourishes, ###### v16 but when the hot wind blows, it disappears, and one can no longer even spot the place where it once grew. ###### v17 But the LORD continually shows loyal love to his faithful followers, and is faithful to their descendants, ###### v18 to those who keep his covenant, who are careful to obey his commands. ###### v19 The LORD has established his throne in heaven; his kingdom extends over everything. ###### v20 Praise the LORD, you angels of his, you powerful warriors who carry out his decrees and obey his orders. ###### v21 Praise the LORD, all you warriors of his, you servants of his who carry out his desires. ###### v22 Praise the LORD, all that he has made, in all the regions of his kingdom. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
