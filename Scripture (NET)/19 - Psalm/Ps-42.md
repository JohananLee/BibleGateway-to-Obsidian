Psalm 42 ###### 1 As a deer longs for streams of water, so I long for you, O God! ###### v2 I thirst for God, for the living God. I say, "When will I be able to go and appear in God's presence?" ###### v3 I cannot eat; I weep day and night. All day long they say to me, "Where is your God?" ###### v4 I will remember and weep. For I was once walking along with the great throng to the temple of God, shouting and giving thanks along with the crowd as we celebrated the holy festival. ###### v5 Why are you depressed, O my soul? Why are you upset? Wait for God! For I will again give thanks to my God for his saving intervention. ###### v6 I am depressed, so I will pray to you while in the region of the upper Jordan, from Hermon, from Mount Mizar. ###### v7 One deep stream calls out to another at the sound of your waterfalls; all your billows and waves overwhelm me. ###### v8 By day the LORD decrees his loyal love, and by night he gives me a song, a prayer to the God of my life. ###### v9 I will pray to God, my high ridge: "Why do you ignore me? Why must I walk around mourning because my enemies oppress me?" ###### v10 My enemies' taunts cut me to the bone, as they say to me all day long, "Where is your God?" ###### v11 Why are you depressed, O my soul? Why are you upset? Wait for God! For I will again give thanks to my God for his saving intervention.
