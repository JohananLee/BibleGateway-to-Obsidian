Psalm 149 ###### 1 Praise the LORD. Sing to the LORD a new song. Praise him in the assembly of the godly. ###### v2 Let Israel rejoice in their Creator. Let the people of Zion delight in their King. ###### v3 Let them praise his name with dancing. Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp. ###### v4 For the LORD takes delight in his people; he exalts the oppressed by delivering them. ###### v5 Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication. Let them shout for joy upon their beds. ###### v6 May the praises of God be in their mouths and a two-edged sword in their hands, ###### v7 in order to take revenge on the nations, and punish foreigners. ###### v8 The godly bind their enemies' kings in chains, and their nobles in iron shackles, ###### v9 and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced. All his loyal followers will be vindicated. Praise the LORD.
