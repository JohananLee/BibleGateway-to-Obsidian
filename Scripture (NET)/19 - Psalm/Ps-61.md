Psalm 61 ###### 1 O God, hear my cry for help. Pay attention to my prayer. ###### v2 From the remotest place on earth I call out to you in my despair. Lead me up to a rocky summit where I can be safe. ###### v3 Indeed, you are my shelter, a strong tower that protects me from the enemy. ###### v4 I will be a permanent guest in your home; I will find shelter in the protection of your wings. (Selah) ###### v5 For you, O God, hear my vows; you grant me the reward that belongs to your loyal followers. ###### v6 Give the king long life. Make his lifetime span several generations. ###### v7 May he reign forever before God. Decree that your loyal love and faithfulness should protect him. ###### v8 Then I will sing praises to your name continually, as I fulfill my vows day after day.
