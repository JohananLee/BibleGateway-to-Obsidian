Psalm 3 ###### 1 LORD, how numerous are my enemies! Many attack me. ###### v2 Many say about me, "God will not deliver him." (Selah) ###### v3 But you, LORD, are a shield that protects me; you are my glory and the one who restores me. ###### v4 To the LORD I cried out, and he answered me from his holy hill. (Selah) ###### v5 I rested and slept; I awoke, for the LORD protects me. ###### v6 I am not afraid of the multitude of people who attack me from all directions. ###### v7 Rise up, LORD! Deliver me, my God! Yes, you will strike all my enemies on the jaw; you will break the teeth of the wicked. ###### v8 The LORD delivers; you show favor to your people. (Selah)
