Psalm 71 ###### 1 In you, O LORD, I have taken shelter. Never let me be humiliated. ###### v2 Vindicate me by rescuing me. Listen to me. Deliver me. ###### v3 Be my protector and refuge, a stronghold where I can be safe. For you are my high ridge and my stronghold. ###### v4 My God, rescue me from the power of the wicked, from the hand of the cruel oppressor. ###### v5 For you are my hope; O Sovereign LORD, I have trusted in you since I was young. ###### v6 I have leaned on you since birth; you pulled me from my mother's womb. I praise you continually. ###### v7 Many are appalled when they see me, but you are my secure shelter. ###### v8 I praise you constantly and speak of your splendor all day long. ###### v9 Do not reject me in my old age. When my strength fails, do not abandon me. ###### v10 For my enemies talk about me; those waiting for a chance to kill me plot my demise. ###### v11 They say, "God has abandoned him. Run and seize him, for there is no one who will rescue him." ###### v12 O God, do not remain far away from me. My God, hurry and help me. ###### v13 May my accusers be humiliated and defeated. May those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace. ###### v14 As for me, I will wait continually, and will continue to praise you. ###### v15 I will tell about your justice, and all day long proclaim your salvation, though I cannot fathom its full extent. ###### v16 I will come and tell about the mighty acts of the Sovereign LORD. I will proclaim your justice--yours alone. ###### v17 O God, you have taught me since I was young, and I am still declaring your amazing deeds. ###### v18 Even when I am old and gray, O God, do not abandon me, until I tell the next generation about your strength, and those coming after me about your power. ###### v19 Your justice, O God, extends to the skies above; you have done great things. O God, who can compare to you? ###### v20 Though you have allowed me to experience much trouble and distress, revive me once again. Bring me up once again from the depths of the earth. ###### v21 Raise me to a position of great honor. Turn and comfort me. ###### v22 I will express my thanks to you with a stringed instrument, praising your faithfulness, O my God. I will sing praises to you accompanied by a harp, O Holy One of Israel. ###### v23 My lips will shout for joy. Yes, I will sing your praises. I will praise you when you rescue me. ###### v24 All day long my tongue will also tell about your justice, for those who want to harm me will be embarrassed and ashamed.
