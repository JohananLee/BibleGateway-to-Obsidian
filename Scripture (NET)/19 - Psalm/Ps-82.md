Psalm 82 ###### 1 God stands in the assembly of El; in the midst of the gods he renders judgment. ###### v2 He says, "How long will you make unjust legal decisions and show favoritism to the wicked? (Selah) ###### v3 Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless. Vindicate the oppressed and suffering. ###### v4 Rescue the poor and needy. Deliver them from the power of the wicked. ###### v5 They neither know nor understand. They stumble around in the dark, while all the foundations of the earth crumble. ###### v6 I thought, 'You are gods; all of you are sons of the Most High.' ###### v7 Yet you will die like mortals; you will fall like all the other rulers." ###### v8 Rise up, O God, and execute judgment on the earth! For you own all the nations.
