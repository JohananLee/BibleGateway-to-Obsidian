Psalm 77 ###### 1 I will cry out to God and call for help. I will cry out to God and he will pay attention to me. ###### v2 In my time of trouble I sought the Lord. I kept my hand raised in prayer throughout the night. I refused to be comforted. ###### v3 I said, "I will remember God while I groan; I will think about him while my strength leaves me." (Selah) ###### v4 You held my eyelids open; I was troubled and could not speak. ###### v5 I thought about the days of old, about ancient times. ###### v6 I said, "During the night I will remember the song I once sang; I will think very carefully." I tried to make sense of what was happening. ###### v7 I asked, "Will the Lord reject me forever? Will he never again show me his favor? ###### v8 Has his loyal love disappeared forever? Has his promise failed forever? ###### v9 Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has his anger stifled his compassion?" (Selah) ###### v10 Then I said, "I am sickened by the thought that the Most High might become inactive. ###### v11 I will remember the works of the LORD. Yes, I will remember the amazing things you did long ago. ###### v12 I will think about all you have done; I will reflect upon your deeds." ###### v13 O God, your deeds are extraordinary. What god can compare to our great God? ###### v14 You are the God who does amazing things; you have revealed your strength among the nations. ###### v15 You delivered your people by your strength-- the children of Jacob and Joseph. (Selah) ###### v16 The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and trembled. Yes, the depths of the sea shook with fear. ###### v17 The clouds poured down rain; the skies thundered. Yes, your arrows flashed about. ###### v18 Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind; the lightning bolts lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook. ###### v19 You walked through the sea; you passed through the surging waters, but left no footprints. ###### v20 You led your people like a flock of sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
