Psalm 69 ###### 1 Deliver me, O God, for the water has reached my neck. ###### v2 I sink into the deep mire where there is no solid ground; I am in deep water, and the current overpowers me. ###### v3 I am exhausted from shouting for help. My throat is sore; my eyes grow tired from looking for my God. ###### v4 Those who hate me without cause are more numerous than the hairs of my head. Those who want to destroy me, my enemies for no reason, outnumber me. They make me repay what I did not steal. ###### v5 O God, you are aware of my foolish sins; my guilt is not hidden from you. ###### v6 Let none who rely on you be disgraced because of me, O Sovereign LORD of Heaven's Armies. Let none who seek you be ashamed because of me, O God of Israel. ###### v7 For I suffer humiliation for your sake and am thoroughly disgraced. ###### v8 My own brothers treat me like a stranger; they act as if I were a foreigner. ###### v9 Certainly zeal for your house consumes me; I endure the insults of those who insult you. ###### v10 I weep and refrain from eating food, which causes others to insult me. ###### v11 I wear sackcloth and they ridicule me. ###### v12 Those who sit at the city gate gossip about me; drunkards mock me in their songs. ###### v13 O LORD, may you hear my prayer and be favorably disposed to me. O God, because of your great loyal love, answer me with your faithful deliverance. ###### v14 Rescue me from the mud. Don't let me sink. Deliver me from those who hate me, from the deep water. ###### v15 Don't let the current overpower me. Don't let the deep swallow me up. Don't let the Pit devour me. ###### v16 Answer me, O LORD, for your loyal love is good. Because of your great compassion, turn toward me. ###### v17 Do not ignore your servant, for I am in trouble. Answer me right away. ###### v18 Come near me and redeem me. Because of my enemies, rescue me. ###### v19 You know how I am insulted, humiliated, and disgraced; you can see all my enemies. ###### v20 Their insults are painful and make me lose heart; I look for sympathy, but receive none, for comforters, but find none. ###### v21 They put bitter poison into my food, and to quench my thirst they give me vinegar to drink. ###### v22 May their dining table become a trap before them. May it be a snare for that group of friends. ###### v23 May their eyes be blinded. Make them shake violently. ###### v24 Pour out your judgment on them. May your raging anger overtake them. ###### v25 May their camp become desolate, their tents uninhabited. ###### v26 For they harass the one whom you discipline; they spread the news about the suffering of those whom you punish. ###### v27 Hold them accountable for all their sins. Do not vindicate them. ###### v28 May their names be deleted from the scroll of the living. Do not let their names be listed with the godly. ###### v29 I am oppressed and suffering. O God, deliver and protect me. ###### v30 I will sing praises to God's name. I will magnify him as I give him thanks. ###### v31 That will please the LORD more than an ox or a bull with horns and hooves. ###### v32 The oppressed look on--let them rejoice. You who seek God, may you be encouraged. ###### v33 For the LORD listens to the needy; he does not despise his captive people. ###### v34 Let the heavens and the earth praise him, along with the seas and everything that swims in them. ###### v35 For God will deliver Zion and rebuild the cities of Judah, and his people will again live in them and possess Zion. ###### v36 The descendants of his servants will inherit it, and those who are loyal to him will live in it.
