Psalm 135 ###### 1 Praise the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD. Offer praise, you servants of the LORD, ###### v2 who serve in the LORD's temple, in the courts of the temple of our God. ###### v3 Praise the LORD, for the LORD is good. Sing praises to his name, for it is pleasant. ###### v4 Indeed, the LORD has chosen Jacob for himself, Israel to be his special possession. ###### v5 Yes, I know the LORD is great, and our Lord is superior to all gods. ###### v6 He does whatever he pleases in heaven and on earth, in the seas and all the ocean depths. ###### v7 He causes the clouds to arise from the end of the earth, makes lightning bolts accompany the rain, and brings the wind out of his storehouses. ###### v8 He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, including both men and animals. ###### v9 He performed awesome deeds and acts of judgment in your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants. ###### v10 He defeated many nations, and killed mighty kings-- ###### v11 Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan. ###### v12 He gave their land as an inheritance, as an inheritance to Israel his people. ###### v13 O LORD, your name endures, your reputation, O LORD, lasts. ###### v14 For the LORD vindicates his people, and has compassion on his servants. ###### v15 The nations' idols are made of silver and gold; they are man-made. ###### v16 They have mouths, but cannot speak, eyes, but cannot see, ###### v17 and ears, but cannot hear. Indeed, they cannot breathe. ###### v18 Those who make them will end up like them, as will everyone who trusts in them. ###### v19 O family of Israel, praise the LORD. O family of Aaron, praise the LORD. ###### v20 O family of Levi, praise the LORD. You loyal followers of the LORD, praise the LORD. ###### v21 The LORD deserves praise in Zion-- he who dwells in Jerusalem. Praise the LORD.
