Psalm 38 ###### 1 O LORD, do not continue to rebuke me in your anger. Do not continue to punish me in your raging fury. ###### v2 For your arrows pierce me, and your hand presses me down. ###### v3 My whole body is sick because of your judgment; I am deprived of health because of my sin. ###### v4 For my sins overwhelm me; like a heavy load, they are too much for me to bear. ###### v5 My wounds are infected and starting to smell, because of my foolish sins. ###### v6 I am dazed and completely humiliated; all day long I walk around mourning. ###### v7 For I am overcome with shame, and my whole body is sick. ###### v8 I am numb with pain and severely battered; I groan loudly because of the anxiety I feel. ###### v9 O Lord, you understand my heart's desire; my groaning is not hidden from you. ###### v10 My heart beats quickly; my strength leaves me. I can hardly see. ###### v11 Because of my condition, even my friends and acquaintances keep their distance; my neighbors stand far away. ###### v12 Those who seek my life try to entrap me; those who want to harm me speak destructive words. All day long they say deceitful things. ###### v13 But I am like a deaf man--I hear nothing; I am like a mute who cannot speak. ###### v14 I am like a man who cannot hear and is incapable of arguing his defense. ###### v15 Yet I wait for you, O LORD! You will respond, O Lord, my God! ###### v16 I have prayed for deliverance, because otherwise they will gloat over me; when my foot slips they will arrogantly taunt me. ###### v17 For I am about to stumble, and I am in constant pain. ###### v18 Yes, I confess my wrongdoing, and I am concerned about my sins. ###### v19 But those who are my enemies for no reason are numerous; those who hate me without cause outnumber me. ###### v20 They repay me evil for the good I have done; though I have tried to do good to them, they hurl accusations at me. ###### v21 Do not abandon me, O LORD. My God, do not remain far away from me. ###### v22 Hurry and help me, O Lord, my deliverer.
