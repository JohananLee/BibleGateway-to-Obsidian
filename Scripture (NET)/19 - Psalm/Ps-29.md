Psalm 29 ###### 1 Acknowledge the LORD, you heavenly beings, acknowledge the LORD's majesty and power. ###### v2 Acknowledge the majesty of the LORD's reputation. Worship the LORD in holy attire. ###### v3 The LORD's shout is heard over the water; the majestic God thunders, the LORD appears over the surging water. ###### v4 The LORD's shout is powerful, the LORD's shout is majestic. ###### v5 The LORD's shout breaks the cedars, the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon. ###### v6 He makes them skip like a calf, Lebanon and Sirion like a young ox. ###### v7 The LORD's shout strikes with flaming fire. ###### v8 The LORD's shout shakes the wilderness, the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. ###### v9 The LORD's shout bends the large trees and strips the leaves from the forests. Everyone in his temple says, "Majestic!" ###### v10 The LORD sits enthroned over the engulfing waters, the LORD sits enthroned as the eternal king. ###### v11 The LORD gives his people strength; the LORD grants his people security.
