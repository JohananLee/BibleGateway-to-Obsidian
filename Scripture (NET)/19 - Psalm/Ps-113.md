Psalm 113 ###### 1 Praise the LORD. Praise, you servants of the LORD, praise the name of the LORD. ###### v2 May the LORD's name be praised now and forevermore. ###### v3 From east to west the LORD's name is deserving of praise. ###### v4 The LORD is exalted over all the nations; his splendor reaches beyond the sky. ###### v5 Who can compare to the LORD our God, who sits on a high throne? ###### v6 He bends down to look at the sky and the earth. ###### v7 He raises the poor from the dirt, and lifts up the needy from the garbage pile, ###### v8 that he might seat him with princes, with the princes of his people. ###### v9 He makes the barren woman of the family a happy mother of children. Praise the LORD.
