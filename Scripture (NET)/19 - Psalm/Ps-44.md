Psalm 44 ###### 1 O God, we have clearly heard; our ancestors have told us what you did in their days, in ancient times. ###### v2 You, by your power, defeated nations and settled our fathers on their land; you crushed the people living there and enabled our ancestors to occupy it. ###### v3 For they did not conquer the land by their swords, and they did not prevail by their strength, but rather by your power, strength, and good favor, for you were partial to them. ###### v4 You are my king, O God. Decree Jacob's deliverance. ###### v5 By your power we will drive back our enemies; by your strength we will trample down our foes. ###### v6 For I do not trust in my bow, and I do not prevail by my sword. ###### v7 For you deliver us from our enemies; you humiliate those who hate us. ###### v8 In God we boast all day long, and we will continually give thanks to your name. (Selah) ###### v9 But you rejected and embarrassed us. You did not go into battle with our armies. ###### v10 You made us retreat from the enemy. Those who hate us take whatever they want from us. ###### v11 You handed us over like sheep to be eaten; you scattered us among the nations. ###### v12 You sold your people for a pittance; you did not ask a high price for them. ###### v13 You made us an object of disdain to our neighbors; those who live on our borders taunt and insult us. ###### v14 You made us an object of ridicule among the nations; foreigners treat us with contempt. ###### v15 All day long I feel humiliated and am overwhelmed with shame, ###### v16 before the vindictive enemy who ridicules and insults me. ###### v17 All this has happened to us, even though we have not rejected you or violated your covenant with us. ###### v18 We have not been unfaithful, nor have we disobeyed your commands. ###### v19 Yet you have battered us, leaving us a heap of ruins overrun by wild dogs; you have covered us with darkness. ###### v20 If we had rejected our God, and spread out our hands in prayer to another god, ###### v21 would not God discover it, for he knows a person's secret thoughts? ###### v22 Yet because of you we are killed all day long; we are treated like sheep at the slaughtering block. ###### v23 Rouse yourself! Why do you sleep, O Lord? Wake up! Do not reject us forever. ###### v24 Why do you look the other way, and ignore the way we are oppressed and mistreated? ###### v25 For we lie in the dirt, with our bellies pressed to the ground. ###### v26 Rise up and help us. Rescue us because of your loyal love.
