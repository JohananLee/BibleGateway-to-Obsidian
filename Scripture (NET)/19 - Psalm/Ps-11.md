Psalm 11 ###### 1 In the LORD I have taken shelter. How can you say to me, "Flee to a mountain like a bird. ###### v2 For look, the wicked prepare their bows, they put their arrows on the strings, to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright. ###### v3 When the foundations are destroyed, what can the godly accomplish?" ###### v4 The LORD is in his holy temple; the LORD's throne is in heaven. His eyes watch; his eyes examine all people. ###### v5 The LORD approves of the godly, but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence. ###### v6 May he rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked! A whirlwind is what they deserve. ###### v7 Certainly the LORD is just; he rewards godly deeds. The upright will experience his favor.
