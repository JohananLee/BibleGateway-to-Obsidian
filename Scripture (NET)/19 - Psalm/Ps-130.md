Psalm 130 ###### 1 From the deep water I cry out to you, O LORD. ###### v2 O Lord, listen to me. Pay attention to my plea for mercy. ###### v3 If you, O LORD, were to keep track of sins, O Lord, who could stand before you? ###### v4 But you are willing to forgive, so that you might be honored. ###### v5 I rely on the LORD. I rely on him with my whole being; I wait for his assuring word. ###### v6 I yearn for the Lord, more than watchmen do for the morning, yes, more than watchmen do for the morning. ###### v7 O Israel, hope in the LORD, for the LORD exhibits loyal love, and is more than willing to deliver. ###### v8 He will deliver Israel from all their sins.
