Psalm 124 ###### 1 "If the LORD had not been on our side"-- let Israel say this.-- ###### v2 if the LORD had not been on our side, when men attacked us, ###### v3 they would have swallowed us alive, when their anger raged against us. ###### v4 The water would have overpowered us; the current would have overwhelmed us. ###### v5 The raging water would have overwhelmed us. ###### v6 The LORD deserves praise, for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth. ###### v7 We escaped with our lives, like a bird from a hunter's snare. The snare broke, and we escaped. ###### v8 Our deliverer is the LORD, the Creator of heaven and earth.
