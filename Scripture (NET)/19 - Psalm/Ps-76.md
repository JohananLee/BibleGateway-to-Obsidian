Psalm 76 ###### 1 God has revealed himself in Judah; in Israel his reputation is great. ###### v2 He lives in Salem; he dwells in Zion. ###### v3 There he shattered the arrows, the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah) ###### v4 You shine brightly and reveal your majesty, as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey. ###### v5 The bravehearted were plundered; they "fell asleep." All the warriors were helpless. ###### v6 At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob, both rider and horse "fell asleep." ###### v7 You are awesome! Yes, you! Who can withstand your intense anger? ###### v8 From heaven you announced what their punishment would be. The earth was afraid and silent ###### v9 when God arose to execute judgment, and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah) ###### v10 Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise; you reveal your anger in full measure. ###### v11 Make vows to the LORD your God and repay them. Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one. ###### v12 He humbles princes; the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.
