Psalm 12 ###### 1 Deliver, LORD! For the godly have disappeared; people of integrity have vanished. ###### v2 People lie to one another; they flatter and deceive. ###### v3 May the LORD cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that boasts! ###### v4 They say, "We speak persuasively; we know how to flatter and boast. Who is our master?" ###### v5 "Because of the violence done to the oppressed, because of the painful cries of the needy, I will spring into action," says the LORD. "I will provide the safety they so desperately desire." ###### v6 The LORD's words are absolutely reliable. They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground, where it is thoroughly refined. ###### v7 You, LORD, will protect them; you will continually shelter each one from these evil people, ###### v8 for the wicked seem to be everywhere, when people promote evil.
