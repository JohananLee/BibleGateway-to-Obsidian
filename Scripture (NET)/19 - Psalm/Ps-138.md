Psalm 138 ###### 1 I will give you thanks with all my heart; before the heavenly assembly I will sing praises to you. ###### v2 I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks to your name, because of your loyal love and faithfulness, for you have exalted your promise above the entire sky. ###### v3 When I cried out for help, you answered me. You made me bold and energized me. ###### v4 Let all the kings of the earth give thanks to you, O LORD, when they hear the words you speak. ###### v5 Let them sing about the LORD's deeds, for the LORD's splendor is magnificent. ###### v6 Though the LORD is exalted, he looks after the lowly, and from far away humbles the proud. ###### v7 Even when I must walk in the midst of danger, you revive me. You oppose my angry enemies, and your right hand delivers me. ###### v8 The LORD avenges me. O LORD, your loyal love endures. Do not abandon those whom you have made.
