Psalm 128 ###### 1 How blessed is every one of the LORD's loyal followers, each one who keeps his commands. ###### v2 You will eat what you worked so hard to grow. You will be blessed and secure. ###### v3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine in the inner rooms of your house; your children will be like olive branches, as they sit all around your table. ###### v4 Yes indeed, the man who fears the LORD will be blessed in this way. ###### v5 May the LORD bless you from Zion, that you might see Jerusalem prosper all the days of your life, ###### v6 and that you might see your grandchildren. May Israel experience peace.
