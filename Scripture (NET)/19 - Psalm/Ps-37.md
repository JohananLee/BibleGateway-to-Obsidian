Psalm 37 ###### 1 Do not fret when wicked men seem to succeed. Do not envy evildoers. ###### v2 For they will quickly dry up like grass, and wither away like plants. ###### v3 Trust in the LORD and do what is right. Settle in the land and maintain your integrity. ###### v4 Then you will take delight in the LORD, and he will answer your prayers. ###### v5 Commit your future to the LORD. Trust in him, and he will act on your behalf. ###### v6 He will vindicate you in broad daylight, and publicly defend your just cause. ###### v7 Wait patiently for the LORD! Wait confidently for him! Do not fret over the apparent success of a sinner, a man who carries out wicked schemes. ###### v8 Do not be angry and frustrated. Do not fret. That only leads to trouble. ###### v9 Wicked men will be wiped out, but those who rely on the LORD are the ones who will possess the land. ###### v10 Evil men will soon disappear; you will stare at the spot where they once were, but they will be gone. ###### v11 But the oppressed will possess the land and enjoy great prosperity. ###### v12 Evil men plot against the godly and viciously attack them. ###### v13 The Lord laughs in disgust at them, for he knows that their day is coming. ###### v14 Evil men draw their swords and prepare their bows, to bring down the oppressed and needy, and to slaughter those who are godly. ###### v15 Their swords will pierce their own hearts, and their bows will be broken. ###### v16 The little bit that a godly man owns is better than the wealth of many evil men, ###### v17 for evil men will lose their power, but the LORD sustains the godly. ###### v18 The LORD watches over the innocent day by day, and they possess a permanent inheritance. ###### v19 They will not be ashamed when hard times come; when famine comes they will have enough to eat. ###### v20 But evil men will die; the LORD's enemies will be incinerated-- they will go up in smoke. ###### v21 Evil men borrow, but do not repay their debt, but the godly show compassion and are generous. ###### v22 Surely those favored by the LORD will possess the land, but those rejected by him will be wiped out. ###### v23 The LORD grants success to the one whose behavior he finds commendable. ###### v24 Even if he trips, he will not fall headlong, for the LORD holds his hand. ###### v25 I was once young, now I am old. I have never seen the godly abandoned, or their children forced to search for food. ###### v26 All day long they show compassion and lend to others, and their children are blessed. ###### v27 Turn away from evil. Do what is right. Then you will enjoy lasting security. ###### v28 For the LORD promotes justice, and never abandons his faithful followers. They are permanently secure, but the children of the wicked are wiped out. ###### v29 The godly will possess the land and will dwell in it permanently. ###### v30 The godly speak wise words and promote justice. ###### v31 The law of their God controls their thinking; their feet do not slip. ###### v32 The wicked set an ambush for the godly and try to kill them. ###### v33 But the LORD does not surrender the godly, or allow them to be condemned in a court of law. ###### v34 Rely on the LORD. Obey his commands. Then he will permit you to possess the land; you will see the demise of the wicked. ###### v35 I have seen ruthless, wicked people growing in influence, like a green tree grows in its native soil. ###### v36 But then one passes by, and suddenly they have disappeared. I looked for them, but they could not be found. ###### v37 Take note of the one who has integrity. Observe the upright. For the one who promotes peace has a future. ###### v38 Sinful rebels are totally destroyed; the wicked have no future. ###### v39 But the LORD delivers the godly; he protects them in times of trouble. ###### v40 The LORD helps them and rescues them; he rescues them from the wicked and delivers them, for they seek his protection.
