Psalm 4 ###### 1 When I call out, answer me, O God who vindicates me. Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place. Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer. ###### v2 You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame? How long will you love what is worthless and search for what is deceptive? (Selah) ###### v3 Realize that the LORD shows the godly special favor; the LORD responds when I cry out to him. ###### v4 Tremble with fear and do not sin. Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways. (Selah) ###### v5 Offer the prescribed sacrifices and trust in the LORD. ###### v6 Many say, "Who can show us anything good?" Smile upon us, LORD! ###### v7 You make me happier than those who have abundant grain and wine. ###### v8 I will lie down and sleep peacefully, for you, LORD, make me safe and secure.
