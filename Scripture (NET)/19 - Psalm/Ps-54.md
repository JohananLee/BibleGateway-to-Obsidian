Psalm 54 ###### 1 O God, deliver me by your name. Vindicate me by your power. ###### v2 O God, listen to my prayer. Pay attention to what I say. ###### v3 For foreigners attack me; ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life. (Selah) ###### v4 Look, God is my deliverer. The Lord is among those who support me. ###### v5 May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil. As a demonstration of your faithfulness, destroy them. ###### v6 With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you. I will give thanks to your name, O LORD, for it is good. ###### v7 Surely he rescues me from all trouble, and I triumph over my enemies.
