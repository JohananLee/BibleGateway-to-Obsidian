Psalm 46 ###### 1 God is our strong refuge; he is truly our helper in times of trouble. ###### v2 For this reason we do not fear when the earth shakes, and the mountains tumble into the depths of the sea, ###### v3 when its waves crash and foam, and the mountains shake before the surging sea. (Selah) ###### v4 The river's channels bring joy to the city of God, the special, holy dwelling place of the Most High. ###### v5 God lives within it, it cannot be moved. God rescues it at the break of dawn. ###### v6 Nations are in uproar, kingdoms are overthrown. God gives a shout, the earth dissolves. ###### v7 The LORD of Heaven's Armies is on our side. The God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah) ###### v8 Come, Witness the exploits of the LORD, who brings devastation to the earth. ###### v9 He brings an end to wars throughout the earth. He shatters the bow and breaks the spear; he burns the shields with fire. ###### v10 He says, "Stop your striving and recognize that I am God. I will be exalted over the nations! I will be exalted over the earth!" ###### v11 The LORD of Heaven's Armies is on our side! The God of Jacob is our stronghold! (Selah)
