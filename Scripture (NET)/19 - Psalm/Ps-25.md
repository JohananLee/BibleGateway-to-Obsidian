Psalm 25 ###### 1 O LORD, I come before you in prayer. ###### v2 My God, I trust in you. Please do not let me be humiliated; do not let my enemies triumphantly rejoice over me. ###### v3 Certainly none who rely on you will be humiliated. Those who deal in treachery will be thwarted and humiliated. ###### v4 Make me understand your ways, O LORD. Teach me your paths. ###### v5 Guide me into your truth and teach me. For you are the God who delivers me; on you I rely all day long. ###### v6 Remember your compassionate and faithful deeds, O LORD, for you have always acted in this manner. ###### v7 Do not hold against me the sins of my youth or my rebellious acts. Because you are faithful to me, extend to me your favor, O LORD. ###### v8 The LORD is both kind and fair; that is why he teaches sinners the right way to live. ###### v9 May he show the humble what is right. May he teach the humble his way. ###### v10 The LORD always proves faithful and reliable to those who follow the demands of his covenant. ###### v11 For the sake of your reputation, O LORD, forgive my sin, because it is great. ###### v12 The LORD shows his faithful followers the way they should live. ###### v13 They experience his favor; their descendants inherit the land. ###### v14 The LORD's loyal followers receive his guidance, and he reveals his covenantal demands to them. ###### v15 I continually look to the LORD for help, for he will free my feet from the enemy's net. ###### v16 Turn toward me and have mercy on me, for I am alone and oppressed. ###### v17 Deliver me from my distress; rescue me from my suffering. ###### v18 See my pain and suffering. Forgive all my sins. ###### v19 Watch my enemies, for they outnumber me; they hate me and want to harm me. ###### v20 Protect me and deliver me! Please do not let me be humiliated, for I have taken shelter in you. ###### v21 May integrity and godliness protect me, for I rely on you. ###### v22 O God, rescue Israel from all their distress!
