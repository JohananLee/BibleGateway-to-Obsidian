Psalm 21 ###### 1 O LORD, the king rejoices in the strength you give; he takes great delight in the deliverance you provide. ###### v2 You grant him his heart's desire; you do not refuse his request. (Selah) ###### v3 For you bring him rich blessings; you place a golden crown on his head. ###### v4 He asked you to sustain his life, and you have granted him long life and an enduring dynasty. ###### v5 Your deliverance brings him great honor; you give him majestic splendor. ###### v6 For you grant him lasting blessings; you give him great joy by allowing him into your presence. ###### v7 For the king trusts in the LORD, and because of the Most High's faithfulness he is not shaken. ###### v8 You prevail over all your enemies; your power is too great for those who hate you. ###### v9 You burn them up like a fiery furnace when you appear. The LORD angrily devours them; the fire consumes them. ###### v10 You destroy their offspring from the earth, their descendants from among the human race. ###### v11 Yes, they intend to do you harm; they dream up a scheme, but they do not succeed. ###### v12 For you make them retreat when you aim your arrows at them. ###### v13 Rise up, O LORD, in strength! We will sing and praise your power.
