Psalm 27 ###### 1 The LORD is my light and my salvation. I fear no one. The LORD protects my life. I am afraid of no one. ###### v2 When evil men attack me to devour my flesh, when my adversaries and enemies attack me, they stumble and fall. ###### v3 Even when an army is deployed against me, I do not fear. Even when war is imminent, I remain confident. ###### v4 I have asked the LORD for one thing-- this is what I desire! I want to live in the LORD's house all the days of my life, so I can gaze at the splendor of the LORD and contemplate in his temple. ###### v5 He will surely give me shelter in the day of danger; he will hide me in his home. He will place me on an inaccessible rocky summit. ###### v6 Now I will triumph over my enemies who surround me. I will offer sacrifices in his dwelling place and shout for joy. I will sing praises to the LORD. ###### v7 Hear me, O LORD, when I cry out. Have mercy on me and answer me. ###### v8 My heart tells me to pray to you, and I do pray to you, O LORD. ###### v9 Do not reject me. Do not push your servant away in anger. You are my deliverer. Do not forsake or abandon me, O God who vindicates me. ###### v10 Even if my father and mother abandoned me, the LORD would take me in. ###### v11 Teach me how you want me to live, LORD; lead me along a level path because of those who wait to ambush me. ###### v12 Do not turn me over to my enemies, for false witnesses who want to destroy me testify against me. ###### v13 Where would I be if I did not believe I would experience the LORD's favor in the land of the living? ###### v14 Rely on the LORD! Be strong and confident! Rely on the LORD!
