Psalm 95 ###### 1 Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD. Let us shout out praises to our Protector who delivers us. ###### v2 Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving. Let us shout out to him in celebration. ###### v3 For the LORD is a great God, a great king who is superior to all gods. ###### v4 The depths of the earth are in his hand, and the mountain peaks belong to him. ###### v5 The sea is his, for he made it. His hands formed the dry land. ###### v6 Come, let us bow down and worship. Let us kneel before the LORD, our Creator. ###### v7 For he is our God; we are the people of his pasture, the sheep he owns. Today, if only you would obey him. ###### v8 He says, "Do not be stubborn like they were at Meribah, like they were that day at Massah in the wilderness, ###### v9 where your ancestors challenged my authority, and tried my patience, even though they had seen my work. ###### v10 For forty years I was continually disgusted with that generation, and I said, 'These people desire to go astray; they do not obey my commands.' ###### v11 So I made a vow in my anger, 'They will never enter into the resting place I had set aside for them.'"
