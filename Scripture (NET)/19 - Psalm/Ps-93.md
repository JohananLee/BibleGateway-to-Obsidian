Psalm 93 ###### 1 The LORD reigns. He is robed in majesty. The LORD is robed; he wears strength around his waist. Indeed, the world is established; it cannot be moved. ###### v2 Your throne has been secure from ancient times; you have always been king. ###### v3 The waves roar, O LORD, the waves roar, the waves roar and crash. ###### v4 Above the sound of the surging water, and the mighty waves of the sea, the LORD sits enthroned in majesty. ###### v5 The rules you set down are completely reliable. Holiness aptly adorns your house, O LORD, forever.
