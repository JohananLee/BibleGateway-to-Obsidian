Psalm 33 ###### 1 You godly ones, shout for joy because of the LORD! It is appropriate for the morally upright to offer him praise. ###### v2 Give thanks to the LORD with the harp. Sing to him to the accompaniment of a ten-stringed instrument. ###### v3 Sing to him a new song. Play skillfully as you shout out your praises to him. ###### v4 For the LORD's decrees are just, and everything he does is fair. ###### v5 He promotes equity and justice; the LORD's faithfulness extends throughout the earth. ###### v6 By the LORD's decree the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth all the starry hosts. ###### v7 He piles up the water of the sea; he puts the oceans in storehouses. ###### v8 Let the whole earth fear the LORD. Let all who live in the world stand in awe of him. ###### v9 For he spoke, and it came into existence. He issued the decree, and it stood firm. ###### v10 The LORD frustrates the decisions of the nations; he nullifies the plans of the peoples. ###### v11 The LORD's decisions stand forever; his plans abide throughout the ages. ###### v12 How blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people whom he has chosen to be his special possession. ###### v13 The LORD watches from heaven; he sees all people. ###### v14 From the place where he lives he looks carefully at all the earth's inhabitants. ###### v15 He is the one who forms every human heart, and takes note of all their actions. ###### v16 No king is delivered by his vast army; a warrior is not saved by his great might. ###### v17 A horse disappoints those who trust in it for victory; despite its great strength, it cannot deliver. ###### v18 Look, the LORD takes notice of his loyal followers, those who wait for him to demonstrate his faithfulness ###### v19 by saving their lives from death and sustaining them during times of famine. ###### v20 We wait for the LORD; he is our deliverer and shield. ###### v21 For our hearts rejoice in him, for we trust in his holy name. ###### v22 May we experience your faithfulness, O LORD, for we wait for you.
