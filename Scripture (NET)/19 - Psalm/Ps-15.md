Psalm 15 ###### 1 LORD, who may be a guest in your home? Who may live on your holy hill? ###### v2 Whoever lives a blameless life, does what is right, and speaks honestly. ###### v3 He does not slander, or do harm to others, or insult his neighbor. ###### v4 He despises a reprobate, but honors the LORD's loyal followers. He makes firm commitments and does not renege on his promise. ###### v5 He does not charge interest when he lends his money. He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent. The one who lives like this will never be shaken.
