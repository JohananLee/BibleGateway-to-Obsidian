Psalm 28 ###### 1 To you, O LORD, I cry out! My Protector, do not ignore me. If you do not respond to me, I will join those who are descending into the grave. ###### v2 Hear my plea for mercy when I cry out to you for help, when I lift my hands toward your holy temple. ###### v3 Do not drag me away with evil men, with those who behave wickedly, who talk so friendly to their neighbors, while they plan to harm them. ###### v4 Pay them back for their evil deeds. Pay them back for what they do. Punish them. ###### v5 For they do not understand the LORD's actions, or the way he carries out justice. The LORD will permanently demolish them. ###### v6 The LORD deserves praise, for he has heard my plea for mercy. ###### v7 The LORD strengthens and protects me; I trust in him with all my heart. I am rescued and my heart is full of joy; I will sing to him in gratitude. ###### v8 The LORD strengthens his people; he protects and delivers his chosen king. ###### v9 Deliver your people. Empower the nation that belongs to you. Care for them like a shepherd and carry them in your arms at all times!
