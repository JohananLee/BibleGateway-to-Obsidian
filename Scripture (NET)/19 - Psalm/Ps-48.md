Psalm 48 ###### 1 The LORD is great and certainly worthy of praise in the city of our God, his holy hill. ###### v2 It is lofty and pleasing to look at, a source of joy to the whole earth. Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon; it is the city of the great king. ###### v3 God is in its fortresses; he reveals himself as its defender. ###### v4 For look, the kings assemble; they advance together. ###### v5 As soon as they see, they are shocked; they are terrified, they quickly retreat. ###### v6 Look at them shake uncontrollably, like a woman writhing in childbirth. ###### v7 With an east wind you shatter the large ships. ###### v8 We heard about God's mighty deeds; now we have seen them, in the city of the LORD of Heaven's Armies, in the city of our God. God makes it permanently secure. (Selah) ###### v9 Within your temple we reflect on your loyal love, O God. ###### v10 The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth is worthy of your reputation, O God. You execute justice. ###### v11 Mount Zion rejoices; the towns of Judah are happy, because of your acts of judgment. ###### v12 Walk around Zion. Encircle it. Count its towers. ###### v13 Consider its defenses. Walk through its fortresses, so you can tell the next generation about it. ###### v14 For God, our God, is our defender forever. He guides us.
