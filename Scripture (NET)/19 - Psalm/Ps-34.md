Psalm 34 ###### 1 I will praise the LORD at all times; my mouth will continually praise him. ###### v2 I will boast in the LORD; let the oppressed hear and rejoice. ###### v3 Magnify the LORD with me. Let us praise his name together. ###### v4 I sought the LORD's help and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. ###### v5 Look to him and be radiant; do not let your faces be ashamed. ###### v6 This oppressed man cried out and the LORD heard; he saved him from all his troubles. ###### v7 The angel of the LORD camps around the LORD's loyal followers and delivers them. ###### v8 Taste and see that the LORD is good. How blessed is the one who takes shelter in him. ###### v9 Fear the LORD, you chosen people of his, for those who fear him lack nothing. ###### v10 Even young lions sometimes lack food and are hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing. ###### v11 Come children. Listen to me. I will teach you what it means to fear the LORD. ###### v12 Do you want to really live? Would you love to live a long, happy life? ###### v13 Then make sure you don't speak evil words or use deceptive speech. ###### v14 Turn away from evil and do what is right. Strive for peace and promote it. ###### v15 The LORD pays attention to the godly and hears their cry for help. ###### v16 But the LORD opposes evildoers and wipes out all memory of them from the earth. ###### v17 The godly cry out and the LORD hears; he saves them from all their troubles. ###### v18 The LORD is near the brokenhearted; he delivers those who are discouraged. ###### v19 The godly face many dangers, but the LORD saves them from each one of them. ###### v20 He protects all his bones; not one of them is broken. ###### v21 Evil people self-destruct; those who hate the godly are punished. ###### v22 The LORD rescues his servants; all who take shelter in him escape punishment.
