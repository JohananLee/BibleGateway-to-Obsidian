Psalm 140 ###### 1 O LORD, rescue me from wicked men. Protect me from violent men, ###### v2 who plan ways to harm me. All day long they stir up conflict. ###### v3 Their tongues wound like a serpent; a viper's venom is behind their lips. (Selah) ###### v4 O LORD, shelter me from the power of the wicked. Protect me from violent men, who plan to knock me over. ###### v5 Proud men hide a snare for me; evil men spread a net by the path. They set traps for me. (Selah) ###### v6 I say to the LORD, "You are my God." O LORD, pay attention to my plea for mercy. ###### v7 O Sovereign LORD, my strong deliverer, you shield my head in the day of battle. ###### v8 O LORD, do not let the wicked have their way. Do not allow their plan to succeed when they attack. (Selah) ###### v9 As for the heads of those who surround me-- may the harm done by their lips overwhelm them. ###### v10 May he rain down fiery coals upon them. May he throw them into the fire. From bottomless pits they will not escape. ###### v11 A slanderer will not endure on the earth; calamity will hunt down a violent man and strike him down. ###### v12 I know that the LORD defends the cause of the oppressed and vindicates the poor. ###### v13 Certainly the godly will give thanks to your name; the morally upright will live in your presence.
