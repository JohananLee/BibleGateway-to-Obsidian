Psalm 24 ###### 1 The LORD owns the earth and all it contains, the world and all who live in it. ###### v2 For he set its foundation upon the seas, and established it upon the ocean currents. ###### v3 Who is allowed to ascend the mountain of the LORD? Who may go up to his holy dwelling place? ###### v4 The one whose deeds are blameless and whose motives are pure, who does not lie, or make promises with no intention of keeping them. ###### v5 Such godly people are rewarded by the LORD, and vindicated by the God who delivers them. ###### v6 Such purity characterizes the people who seek his favor, Jacob's descendants, who pray to him. (Selah) ###### v7 Look up, you gates. Rise up, you eternal doors. Then the majestic king will enter. ###### v8 Who is this majestic king? The LORD who is strong and mighty. The LORD who is mighty in battle. ###### v9 Look up, you gates. Rise up, you eternal doors. Then the majestic king will enter. ###### v10 Who is this majestic king? The LORD of Heaven's Armies. He is the majestic king. (Selah)
