Psalm 132 ###### 1 O LORD, for David's sake remember all his strenuous effort, ###### v2 and how he made a vow to the LORD, and swore an oath to the Powerful One of Jacob. ###### v3 He said, "I will not enter my own home, or get into my bed. ###### v4 I will not allow my eyes to sleep, or my eyelids to slumber, ###### v5 until I find a place for the LORD, a fine dwelling place for the Powerful One of Jacob." ###### v6 Look, we heard about it in Ephrathah; we found it in the territory of Jaar. ###### v7 Let us go to his dwelling place. Let us worship before his footstool. ###### v8 Ascend, O LORD, to your resting place, you and the ark of your strength. ###### v9 May your priests be clothed with integrity. May your loyal followers shout for joy. ###### v10 For the sake of David, your servant, do not reject your chosen king. ###### v11 The LORD made a reliable promise to David; he will not go back on his word. He said, "I will place one of your descendants on your throne. ###### v12 If your sons keep my covenant and the rules I teach them, their sons will also sit on your throne forever." ###### v13 Certainly the LORD has chosen Zion; he decided to make it his home. ###### v14 He said, "This will be my resting place forever; I will live here, for I have chosen it. ###### v15 I will abundantly supply what she needs; I will give her poor all the food they need. ###### v16 I will protect her priests, and her godly people will shout exuberantly. ###### v17 There I will make David strong; I have determined that my chosen king's dynasty will continue. ###### v18 I will humiliate his enemies, and his crown will shine."
