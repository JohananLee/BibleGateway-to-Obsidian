Psalm 86 ###### 1 Listen, O LORD. Answer me. For I am oppressed and needy. ###### v2 Protect me, for I am loyal. You are my God; deliver your servant who trusts in you. ###### v3 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I cry out to you all day long. ###### v4 Make your servant glad, for to you, O Lord, I pray. ###### v5 Certainly, O Lord, you are kind and forgiving, and show great faithfulness to all who cry out to you. ###### v6 O LORD, hear my prayer. Pay attention to my plea for mercy. ###### v7 In my time of trouble I cry out to you, for you will answer me. ###### v8 None can compare to you among the gods, O Lord. Your exploits are incomparable. ###### v9 All the nations, whom you created, will come and worship you, O Lord. They will honor your name. ###### v10 For you are great and do amazing things. You alone are God. ###### v11 O LORD, teach me how you want me to live. Then I will obey your commands. Make me wholeheartedly committed to you. ###### v12 O Lord, my God, I will give you thanks with my whole heart. I will honor your name continually. ###### v13 For you will extend your great loyal love to me, and will deliver my life from the depths of Sheol. ###### v14 O God, arrogant men attack me; a gang of ruthless men, who do not respect you, seek my life. ###### v15 But you, O Lord, are a compassionate and merciful God. You are patient and demonstrate great loyal love and faithfulness. ###### v16 Turn toward me and have mercy on me. Give your servant your strength. Deliver this son of your female servant. ###### v17 Show me evidence of your favor. Then those who hate me will see it and be ashamed, for you, O LORD, will help me and comfort me.
