Psalm 9 ###### 1 I will thank the LORD with all my heart! I will tell about all your amazing deeds. ###### v2 I will be happy and rejoice in you. I will sing praises to you, O Most High. ###### v3 When my enemies turn back, they trip and are defeated before you. ###### v4 For you defended my just cause; from your throne you pronounced a just decision. ###### v5 You terrified the nations with your battle cry. You destroyed the wicked; you permanently wiped out all memory of them. ###### v6 The enemy's cities have been reduced to permanent ruins. You destroyed their cities; all memory of the enemies has perished. ###### v7 But the LORD rules forever; he reigns in a just manner. ###### v8 He judges the world fairly; he makes just legal decisions for the nations. ###### v9 Consequently the LORD provides safety for the oppressed; he provides safety in times of trouble. ###### v10 Your loyal followers trust in you, for you, LORD, do not abandon those who seek your help. ###### v11 Sing praises to the LORD, who rules in Zion. Tell the nations what he has done. ###### v12 For the one who takes revenge against murderers took notice of the oppressed; he did not overlook their cry for help ###### v13 when they prayed: "Have mercy on me, LORD! See how I am oppressed by those who hate me, O one who can snatch me away from the gates of death! ###### v14 Then I will tell about all your praiseworthy acts; in the gates of Daughter Zion I will rejoice because of your deliverance." ###### v15 The nations fell into the pit they had made; their feet were caught in the net they had hidden. ###### v16 The LORD revealed himself; he accomplished justice. The wicked were ensnared by their own actions. (Higgaion. Selah) ###### v17 The wicked are turned back and sent to Sheol; this is the destiny of all the nations that ignore God, ###### v18 for the needy are not permanently ignored, the hopes of the oppressed are not forever dashed. ###### v19 Rise up, LORD! Don't let men be defiant. May the nations be judged in your presence. ###### v20 Terrify them, LORD. Let the nations know they are mere mortals. (Selah)
