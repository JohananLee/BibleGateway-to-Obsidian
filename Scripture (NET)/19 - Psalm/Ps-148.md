Psalm 148 ###### 1 Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD from the sky. Praise him in the heavens. ###### v2 Praise him, all his angels. Praise him, all his heavenly assembly. ###### v3 Praise him, O sun and moon. Praise him, all you shiny stars. ###### v4 Praise him, O highest heaven, and you waters above the sky. ###### v5 Let them praise the name of the LORD, for he gave the command and they came into existence. ###### v6 He established them so they would endure; he issued a decree that will not be revoked. ###### v7 Praise the LORD from the earth, you sea creatures and all you ocean depths, ###### v8 O fire and hail, snow and clouds, O stormy wind that carries out his orders, ###### v9 you mountains and all you hills, you fruit trees and all you cedars, ###### v10 you animals and all you cattle, you creeping things and birds, ###### v11 you kings of the earth and all you nations, you princes and all you leaders on the earth, ###### v12 you young men and young women, you elderly, along with you children. ###### v13 Let them praise the name of the LORD, for his name alone is exalted; his majesty extends over the earth and sky. ###### v14 He has made his people victorious, and given all his loyal followers reason to praise-- the Israelites, the people who are close to him. Praise the LORD!
