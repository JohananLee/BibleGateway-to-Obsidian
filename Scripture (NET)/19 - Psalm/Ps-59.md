Psalm 59 ###### 1 Deliver me from my enemies, my God. Protect me from those who attack me. ###### v2 Deliver me from evildoers. Rescue me from violent men. ###### v3 For look, they wait to ambush me; powerful men stalk me, but not because I have rebelled or sinned, O LORD. ###### v4 Though I have done nothing wrong, they are anxious to attack. Spring into action and help me. Take notice of me. ###### v5 You, O LORD God of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, rouse yourself and punish all the nations. Have no mercy on any treacherous evildoers. (Selah) ###### v6 They return in the evening; they growl like dogs and prowl around outside the city. ###### v7 Look, they hurl insults at me and openly threaten to kill me, for they say, "Who hears?" ###### v8 But you, O LORD, laugh in disgust at them; you taunt all the nations. ###### v9 You are my source of strength. I will wait for you. For God is my refuge. ###### v10 The God who loves me will help me; God will enable me to triumph over my enemies. ###### v11 Do not strike them dead suddenly, because then my people might forget the lesson. Use your power to make them homeless vagabonds and then bring them down, O Lord who shields us. ###### v12 They speak sinful words. So let them be trapped by their own pride and by the curses and lies they speak. ###### v13 Angrily wipe them out. Wipe them out so they vanish. Let them know that God rules over Jacob and to the ends of the earth. (Selah) ###### v14 They return in the evening; they growl like dogs and prowl around outside the city. ###### v15 They wander around looking for something to eat; they refuse to sleep until they are full. ###### v16 As for me, I will sing about your strength; I will praise your loyal love in the morning. For you are my refuge and my place of shelter when I face trouble. ###### v17 You are my source of strength. I will sing praises to you. For God is my refuge, the God who loves me.
