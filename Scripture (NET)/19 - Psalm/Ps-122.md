Psalm 122 ###### 1 I was glad because they said to me, "We will go to the LORD's temple." ###### v2 Our feet are standing inside your gates, O Jerusalem. ###### v3 Jerusalem is a city designed to accommodate an assembly. ###### v4 The tribes go up there, the tribes of the LORD, where it is required that Israel give thanks to the name of the LORD. ###### v5 Indeed, the leaders sit there on thrones and make legal decisions, on the thrones of the house of David. ###### v6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. May those who love her prosper. ###### v7 May there be peace inside your defenses, and prosperity inside your fortresses. ###### v8 For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors I will say, "May there be peace in you." ###### v9 For the sake of the temple of the LORD our God I will pray for you to prosper.
