Psalm 146 ###### 1 Praise the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul. ###### v2 I will praise the LORD as long as I live. I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist. ###### v3 Do not trust in princes, or in human beings, who cannot deliver. ###### v4 Their life's breath departs, they return to the ground. On that day their plans die. ###### v5 How blessed is the one whose helper is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God, ###### v6 the one who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who remains forever faithful, ###### v7 vindicates the oppressed, and gives food to the hungry. The LORD releases the imprisoned. ###### v8 The LORD gives sight to the blind. The LORD lifts up all who are bent over. The LORD loves the godly. ###### v9 The LORD protects the resident foreigner. He lifts up the fatherless and the widow, but he opposes the wicked. ###### v10 The LORD rules forever, your God, O Zion, throughout the generations to come. Praise the LORD!
