Psalm 39 ###### 1 I decided, "I will watch what I say and make sure I do not sin with my tongue. I will put a muzzle over my mouth while in the presence of an evil person." ###### v2 I was stone silent; I held back the urge to speak. My frustration grew; ###### v3 my anxiety intensified. As I thought about it, I became impatient. Finally I spoke these words: ###### v4 "O LORD, help me understand my mortality and the brevity of life. Let me realize how quickly my life will pass. ###### v5 Look, you make my days short-lived, and my life span is nothing from your perspective. Surely all people, even those who seem secure, are nothing but vapor. (Selah) ###### v6 Surely people go through life as mere ghosts. Surely they accumulate worthless wealth without knowing who will eventually haul it away." ###### v7 But now, O Lord, upon what am I relying? You are my only hope! ###### v8 Deliver me from all my sins of rebellion. Do not make me the object of fools' insults. ###### v9 I am silent and cannot open my mouth because of what you have done. ###### v10 Please stop wounding me. You have almost beaten me to death. ###### v11 You severely discipline people for their sins; like a moth you slowly devour their strength. Surely all people are a mere vapor. (Selah) ###### v12 Hear my prayer, O LORD. Listen to my cry for help. Do not ignore my sobbing. For I am a resident foreigner with you, a temporary settler, just as all my ancestors were. ###### v13 Turn your angry gaze away from me, so I can be happy before I pass away.
