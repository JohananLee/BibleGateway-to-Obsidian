Psalm 81 ###### 1 Shout for joy to God, our source of strength! Shout out to the God of Jacob! ###### v2 Sing a song and play the tambourine, the pleasant-sounding harp, and the ten-stringed instrument. ###### v3 Sound the ram's horn on the day of the new moon, and on the day of the full moon when our festival begins. ###### v4 For observing the festival is a requirement for Israel; it is an ordinance given by the God of Jacob. ###### v5 He decreed it as a regulation in Joseph, when he attacked the land of Egypt. I heard a voice I did not recognize. ###### v6 It said: "I removed the burden from his shoulder; his hands were released from holding the basket. ###### v7 In your distress you called out and I rescued you. I answered you from a dark thundercloud. I tested you at the waters of Meribah. (Selah) ###### v8 I said, 'Listen, my people! I will warn you. O Israel, if only you would obey me! ###### v9 There must be no other god among you. You must not worship a foreign god. ###### v10 I am the LORD, your God, the one who brought you out of the land of Egypt. Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.' ###### v11 But my people did not obey me; Israel did not submit to me. ###### v12 I gave them over to their stubborn desires; they did what seemed right to them. ###### v13 If only my people would obey me! If only Israel would keep my commands! ###### v14 Then I would quickly subdue their enemies, and attack their adversaries." ###### v15 (May those who hate the LORD cower in fear before him. May they be permanently humiliated.) ###### v16 "I would feed Israel the best wheat, and would satisfy your appetite with honey from the rocky cliffs."
