Psalm 85 ###### 1 O LORD, you showed favor to your land; you restored the well-being of Jacob. ###### v2 You pardoned the wrongdoing of your people; you forgave all their sin. (Selah) ###### v3 You withdrew all your fury; you turned back from your raging anger. ###### v4 Restore us, O God our deliverer. Do not be displeased with us. ###### v5 Will you stay mad at us forever? Will you remain angry throughout future generations? ###### v6 Will you not revive us once more? Then your people will rejoice in you. ###### v7 O LORD, show us your loyal love. Bestow on us your deliverance. ###### v8 I will listen to what God the LORD says. For he will make peace with his people, his faithful followers. Yet they must not return to their foolish ways. ###### v9 Certainly his loyal followers will soon experience his deliverance; then his splendor will again appear in our land. ###### v10 Loyal love and faithfulness meet; deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss. ###### v11 Faithfulness grows from the ground, and deliverance looks down from the sky. ###### v12 Yes, the LORD will bestow his good blessings, and our land will yield its crops. ###### v13 Deliverance goes before him, and prepares a pathway for him.
