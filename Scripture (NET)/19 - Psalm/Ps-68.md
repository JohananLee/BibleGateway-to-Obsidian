Psalm 68 ###### 1 God springs into action. His enemies scatter; his adversaries run from him. ###### v2 As smoke is driven away by the wind, so you drive them away. As wax melts before fire, so the wicked are destroyed before God. ###### v3 But the godly are happy; they rejoice before God and are overcome with joy. ###### v4 Sing to God! Sing praises to his name. Exalt the one who rides on the clouds. For the LORD is his name. Rejoice before him. ###### v5 He is a father to the fatherless and an advocate for widows. God rules from his holy dwelling place. ###### v6 God settles in their own homes those who have been deserted; he frees prisoners and grants them prosperity. But sinful rebels live in the desert. ###### v7 O God, when you lead your people into battle, when you march through the wastelands, (Selah) ###### v8 the earth shakes. Yes, the heavens pour down rain before God, the God of Sinai, before God, the God of Israel. ###### v9 O God, you cause abundant showers to fall on your chosen people. When they are tired, you sustain them, ###### v10 for you live among them. You sustain the oppressed with your good blessings, O God. ###### v11 The Lord speaks; many, many women spread the good news. ###### v12 Kings leading armies run away--they run away! The lovely lady of the house divides up the loot. ###### v13 When you lie down among the sheepfolds, the wings of the dove are covered with silver and with glittering gold. ###### v14 When the Sovereign One scatters kings, let it snow on Zalmon. ###### v15 The mountain of Bashan is a towering mountain; the mountain of Bashan is a mountain with many peaks. ###### v16 Why do you look with envy, O mountains with many peaks, at the mountain where God has decided to live? Indeed the LORD will live there permanently. ###### v17 God has countless chariots; they number in the thousands. The Lord comes from Sinai in holy splendor. ###### v18 You ascend on high; you have taken many captives. You receive tribute from men, including even sinful rebels. Indeed, the LORD God lives there. ###### v19 The Lord deserves praise. Day after day he carries our burden, the God who delivers us. (Selah) ###### v20 Our God is a God who delivers; the LORD, the Sovereign Lord, can rescue from death. ###### v21 Indeed, God strikes the heads of his enemies, the hairy foreheads of those who persist in rebellion. ###### v22 The Lord says, "I will retrieve them from Bashan. I will bring them back from the depths of the sea, ###### v23 so that your feet may stomp in their blood, and your dogs may eat their portion of the enemies' corpses." ###### v24 They see your processions, O God-- the processions of my God, my king, who marches along in holy splendor. ###### v25 Singers walk in front; musicians follow playing their stringed instruments, in the midst of young women playing tambourines. ###### v26 In your large assemblies praise God, the LORD, in the assemblies of Israel. ###### v27 There is little Benjamin, their ruler, and the princes of Judah in their robes, along with the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali. ###### v28 God has decreed that you will be powerful. O God, you who have acted on our behalf, demonstrate your power. ###### v29 Because of your temple in Jerusalem, kings bring tribute to you. ###### v30 Sound your battle cry against the wild beast of the reeds, and the nations that assemble like a herd of calves led by bulls. They humble themselves and offer gold and silver as tribute. God scatters the nations that like to do battle. ###### v31 They come with red cloth from Egypt. Ethiopia voluntarily offers tribute to God. ###### v32 O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God. Sing praises to the Lord, (Selah) ###### v33 to the one who rides through the sky from ancient times. Look! He thunders loudly. ###### v34 Acknowledge God's power, his sovereignty over Israel, and the power he reveals in the skies. ###### v35 You are awe-inspiring, O God, as you emerge from your holy temple. It is the God of Israel who gives the people power and strength. God deserves praise!
