Psalm 45 ###### 1 My heart is stirred by a beautiful song. I say, "I have composed this special song for the king; my tongue is as skilled as the stylus of an experienced scribe." ###### v2 You are the most handsome of all men. You speak in an impressive and fitting manner. For this reason God grants you continual blessings. ###### v3 Strap your sword to your thigh, O warrior. Appear in your majestic splendor. ###### v4 Appear in your majesty and be victorious. Ride forth for the sake of what is right, on behalf of justice. Then your right hand will accomplish mighty acts. ###### v5 Your arrows are sharp and penetrate the hearts of the king's enemies. Nations fall at your feet. ###### v6 Your throne, O God, is permanent. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice. ###### v7 You love justice and hate evil. For this reason God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy, elevating you above your companions. ###### v8 All your garments are perfumed with myrrh, aloes, and cassia. From the luxurious palaces comes the music of stringed instruments that makes you happy. ###### v9 Princesses are among your honored women. Your bride stands at your right hand, wearing jewelry made with gold from Ophir. ###### v10 Listen, O princess. Observe and pay attention! Forget your homeland and your family. ###### v11 Then the king will be attracted by your beauty. After all, he is your master. Submit to him. ###### v12 Rich people from Tyre will seek your favor by bringing a gift. ###### v13 The princess looks absolutely magnificent, decked out in pearls and clothed in a brocade trimmed with gold. ###### v14 In embroidered robes she is escorted to the king. Her attendants, the maidens of honor who follow her, are led before you. ###### v15 They are bubbling with joy as they walk in procession and enter the royal palace. ###### v16 Your sons will carry on the dynasty of your ancestors; you will make them princes throughout the land. ###### v17 I will proclaim your greatness through the coming years, then the nations will praise you forever.
