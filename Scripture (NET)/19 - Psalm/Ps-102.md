Psalm 102 ###### 1 O LORD, hear my prayer. Pay attention to my cry for help. ###### v2 Do not ignore me in my time of trouble. Listen to me. When I call out to you, quickly answer me. ###### v3 For my days go up in smoke, and my bones are charred as in a fireplace. ###### v4 My heart is parched and withered like grass, for I am unable to eat food. ###### v5 Because of the anxiety that makes me groan, my bones protrude from my skin. ###### v6 I am like an owl in the wilderness; I am like a screech owl among the ruins. ###### v7 I stay awake; I am like a solitary bird on a roof. ###### v8 All day long my enemies taunt me; those who mock me use my name in their curses. ###### v9 For I eat ashes as if they were bread, and mix my drink with my tears, ###### v10 because of your anger and raging fury. Indeed, you pick me up and throw me away. ###### v11 My days are coming to an end, and I am withered like grass. ###### v12 But you, O LORD, rule forever, and your reputation endures. ###### v13 You will rise up and have compassion on Zion. For it is time to have mercy on her, for the appointed time has come. ###### v14 Indeed, your servants take delight in her stones, and feel compassion for the dust of her ruins. ###### v15 The nations will respect the reputation of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth will respect his splendor, ###### v16 when the LORD rebuilds Zion, and reveals his splendor, ###### v17 when he responds to the prayer of the destitute, and does not reject their request. ###### v18 The account of his intervention will be recorded for future generations; people yet to be born will praise the LORD. ###### v19 For he will look down from his sanctuary above; from heaven the LORD will look toward earth, ###### v20 in order to hear the painful cries of the prisoners, and to set free those condemned to die, ###### v21 so they may proclaim the name of the LORD in Zion, and praise him in Jerusalem, ###### v22 when the nations gather together, and the kingdoms pay tribute to the LORD. ###### v23 He has taken away my strength in the middle of life; he has cut short my days. ###### v24 I say, "O my God, please do not take me away in the middle of my life. You endure through all generations. ###### v25 In earlier times you established the earth; the skies are your handiwork. ###### v26 They will perish, but you will endure. They will wear out like a garment; like clothes you will remove them and they will disappear. ###### v27 But you remain; your years do not come to an end. ###### v28 The children of your servants will settle down here, and their descendants will live securely in your presence."
