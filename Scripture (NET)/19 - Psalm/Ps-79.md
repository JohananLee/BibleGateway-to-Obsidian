Psalm 79 ###### 1 O God, foreigners have invaded your chosen land; they have polluted your holy temple and turned Jerusalem into a heap of ruins. ###### v2 They have given the corpses of your servants to the birds of the sky, the flesh of your loyal followers to the beasts of the earth. ###### v3 They have made their blood flow like water all around Jerusalem, and there is no one to bury them. ###### v4 We have become an object of disdain to our neighbors; those who live on our borders taunt and insult us. ###### v5 How long will this go on, O LORD? Will you stay angry forever? How long will your rage burn like fire? ###### v6 Pour out your anger on the nations that do not acknowledge you, on the kingdoms that do not pray to you. ###### v7 For they have devoured Jacob and destroyed his home. ###### v8 Do not hold us accountable for the sins of earlier generations. Quickly send your compassion our way, for we are in serious trouble. ###### v9 Help us, O God, our deliverer! For the sake of your glorious reputation, rescue us. Forgive our sins for the sake of your reputation. ###### v10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Before our very eyes may the shed blood of your servants be avenged among the nations. ###### v11 Listen to the painful cries of the prisoners. Use your great strength to set free those condemned to die. ###### v12 Pay back our neighbors in full. May they be insulted the same way they insulted you, O Lord. ###### v13 Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will continually thank you. We will tell coming generations of your praiseworthy acts.
