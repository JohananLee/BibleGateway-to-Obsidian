Psalm 55 ###### 1 Listen, O God, to my prayer. Do not ignore my appeal for mercy. ###### v2 Pay attention to me and answer me. I am so upset and distressed, I am beside myself, ###### v3 because of what the enemy says, and because of how the wicked pressure me, for they hurl trouble down upon me and angrily attack me. ###### v4 My heart beats violently within me; the horrors of death overcome me. ###### v5 Fear and panic overpower me; terror overwhelms me. ###### v6 I say, "I wish I had wings like a dove. I would fly away and settle in a safe place. ###### v7 Look, I will escape to a distant place; I will stay in the wilderness. (Selah) ###### v8 I will hurry off to a place that is safe from the strong wind and the gale." ###### v9 Confuse them, O Lord. Frustrate their plans. For I see violence and conflict in the city. ###### v10 Day and night they walk around on its walls, while wickedness and destruction are within it. ###### v11 Disaster is within it; violence and deceit do not depart from its public square. ###### v12 Indeed, it is not an enemy who insults me, or else I could bear it; it is not one who hates me who arrogantly taunts me, or else I could hide from him. ###### v13 But it is you, a man like me, my close friend in whom I confided. ###### v14 We would share personal thoughts with each other; in God's temple we would walk together among the crowd. ###### v15 May death destroy them. May they go down alive into Sheol. For evil is in their dwelling place and in their midst. ###### v16 As for me, I will call out to God, and the LORD will deliver me. ###### v17 During the evening, morning, and noontime I will lament and moan, and he will hear me. ###### v18 He will rescue me and protect me from those who attack me, even though they greatly outnumber me. ###### v19 God, the one who has reigned as king from long ago, will hear and humiliate them. (Selah) They refuse to change, and do not fear God. ###### v20 He attacks his friends; he breaks his solemn promises to them. ###### v21 His words are as smooth as butter, but he harbors animosity in his heart. His words seem softer than oil, but they are really like sharp swords. ###### v22 Throw your burden upon the LORD, and he will sustain you. He will never allow the godly to be shaken. ###### v23 But you, O God, will bring them down to the deep Pit. Violent and deceitful people will not live even half a normal lifespan. But as for me, I trust in you.
