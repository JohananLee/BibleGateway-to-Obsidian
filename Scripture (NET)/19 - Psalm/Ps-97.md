Psalm 97 ###### 1 The LORD reigns. Let the earth be happy. Let the many coastlands rejoice. ###### v2 Dark clouds surround him; equity and justice are the foundation of his throne. ###### v3 Fire goes before him; on every side it burns up his enemies. ###### v4 His lightning bolts light up the world; the earth sees and trembles. ###### v5 The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of the whole earth. ###### v6 The sky declares his justice, and all the nations see his splendor. ###### v7 All who worship idols are ashamed, those who boast about worthless idols. All the gods bow down before him. ###### v8 Zion hears and rejoices, the towns of Judah are happy, because of your judgments, O LORD. ###### v9 For you, O LORD, are the Most High over the whole earth; you are elevated high above all gods. ###### v10 You who love the LORD, hate evil! He protects the lives of his faithful followers; he delivers them from the power of the wicked. ###### v11 The godly bask in the light; the morally upright experience joy. ###### v12 You godly ones, rejoice in the LORD. Give thanks to his holy name.
