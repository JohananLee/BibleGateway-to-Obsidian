Psalm 112 ###### 1 Praise the LORD! How blessed is the one who obeys the LORD, who takes great delight in keeping his commands. ###### v2 His descendants will be powerful on the earth; the godly will be blessed. ###### v3 His house contains wealth and riches; his integrity endures. ###### v4 In the darkness a light shines for the godly, for each one who is merciful, compassionate, and just. ###### v5 It goes well for the one who generously lends money, and conducts his business honestly. ###### v6 For he will never be shaken; others will always remember one who is just. ###### v7 He does not fear bad news. He is confident; he trusts in the LORD. ###### v8 His resolve is firm; he will not succumb to fear before he looks in triumph on his enemies. ###### v9 He generously gives to the needy; his integrity endures. He will be vindicated and honored. ###### v10 When the wicked see this, they will worry; they will grind their teeth in frustration and melt away. The desire of the wicked will perish.
