Psalm 14 ###### 1 Fools say to themselves, "There is no God." They sin and commit evil deeds; none of them does what is right. ###### v2 The LORD looks down from heaven at the human race, to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God. ###### v3 Everyone rejects God; they are all morally corrupt. None of them does what is right, not even one. ###### v4 All those who behave wickedly do not understand-- those who devour my people as if they were eating bread, and do not call out to the LORD. ###### v5 They are absolutely terrified, for God defends the godly. ###### v6 You want to humiliate the oppressed, even though the LORD is their shelter. ###### v7 I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores the well-being of his people, may Jacob rejoice, may Israel be happy!
