Psalm 104 ###### 1 Praise the LORD, O my soul! O LORD my God, you are magnificent. You are robed in splendor and majesty. ###### v2 He covers himself with light as if it were a garment. He stretches out the skies like a tent curtain, ###### v3 and lays the beams of the upper rooms of his palace on the rain clouds. He makes the clouds his chariot, and travels on the wings of the wind. ###### v4 He makes the winds his messengers, and the flaming fire his attendant. ###### v5 He established the earth on its foundations; it will never be moved. ###### v6 The watery deep covered it like a garment; the waters reached above the mountains. ###### v7 Your shout made the waters retreat; at the sound of your thunderous voice they hurried off-- ###### v8 as the mountains rose up, and the valleys went down-- to the place you appointed for them. ###### v9 You set up a boundary for them that they could not cross, so that they would not cover the earth again. ###### v10 He turns springs into streams; they flow between the mountains. ###### v11 They provide water for all the animals in the field; the wild donkeys quench their thirst. ###### v12 The birds of the sky live beside them; they chirp among the bushes. ###### v13 He waters the mountains from the upper rooms of his palace; the earth is full of the fruit you cause to grow. ###### v14 He provides grass for the cattle, and crops for people to cultivate, so they can produce food from the ground, ###### v15 as well as wine that makes people glad, and olive oil to make their faces shine, as well as bread that sustains them. ###### v16 The trees of the LORD receive all the rain they need, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted, ###### v17 where the birds make nests, near the evergreens in which the herons live. ###### v18 The wild goats live in the high mountains; the rock badgers find safety in the cliffs. ###### v19 He made the moon to mark the months, and the sun sets according to a regular schedule. ###### v20 You make it dark and night comes, during which all the beasts of the forest prowl around. ###### v21 The lions roar for prey, seeking their food from God. ###### v22 When the sun rises, they withdraw and sleep in their dens. ###### v23 People then go out to do their work, and they labor until evening. ###### v24 How many living things you have made, O LORD! You have exhibited great skill in making all of them; the earth is full of the living things you have made. ###### v25 Over here is the deep, wide sea, which teems with innumerable swimming creatures, living things both small and large. ###### v26 The ships travel there, and over here swims the whale you made to play in it. ###### v27 All your creatures wait for you to provide them with food on a regular basis. ###### v28 You give food to them and they receive it; you open your hand and they are filled with food. ###### v29 When you ignore them, they panic. When you take away their life's breath, they die and return to dust. ###### v30 When you send your life-giving breath, they are created, and you replenish the surface of the ground. ###### v31 May the splendor of the LORD endure. May the LORD find pleasure in the living things he has made. ###### v32 He looks down on the earth and it shakes; he touches the mountains and they start to smolder. ###### v33 I will sing to the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praise to my God as long as I exist. ###### v34 May my thoughts be pleasing to him. I will rejoice in the LORD. ###### v35 May sinners disappear from the earth, and the wicked vanish. Praise the LORD, O my soul. Praise the LORD.
