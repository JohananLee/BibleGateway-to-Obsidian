Psalm 91 ###### 1 As for you, the one who lives in the shelter of the Most High, and resides in the protective shadow of the Sovereign One-- ###### v2 I say this about the LORD, my shelter and my stronghold, my God in whom I trust-- ###### v3 he will certainly rescue you from the snare of the hunter and from the destructive plague. ###### v4 He will shelter you with his wings; you will find safety under his wings. His faithfulness is like a shield or a protective wall. ###### v5 You need not fear the terrors of the night, the arrow that flies by day, ###### v6 the plague that stalks in the darkness, or the disease that ravages at noon. ###### v7 Though a thousand may fall beside you, and a multitude on your right side, it will not reach you. ###### v8 Certainly you will see it with your very own eyes-- you will see the wicked paid back. ###### v9 For you have taken refuge in the LORD, my shelter, the Most High. ###### v10 No harm will overtake you; no illness will come near your home. ###### v11 For he will order his angels to protect you in all you do. ###### v12 They will lift you up in their hands, so you will not slip and fall on a stone. ###### v13 You will subdue a lion and a snake; you will trample underfoot a young lion and a serpent. ###### v14 The LORD says, "Because he is devoted to me, I will deliver him; I will protect him because he is loyal to me. ###### v15 When he calls out to me, I will answer him. I will be with him when he is in trouble; I will rescue him and bring him honor. ###### v16 I will satisfy him with long life, and will let him see my salvation."
