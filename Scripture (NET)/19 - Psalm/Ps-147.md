Psalm 147 ###### 1 Praise the LORD, for it is good to sing praises to our God. Yes, praise is pleasant and appropriate. ###### v2 The LORD rebuilds Jerusalem, and gathers the exiles of Israel. ###### v3 He heals the brokenhearted, and bandages their wounds. ###### v4 He counts the number of the stars; he names all of them. ###### v5 Our Lord is great and has awesome power; there is no limit to his wisdom. ###### v6 The LORD lifts up the oppressed, but knocks the wicked to the ground. ###### v7 Offer to the LORD a song of thanks. Sing praises to our God to the accompaniment of a harp. ###### v8 He covers the sky with clouds, provides the earth with rain, and causes grass to grow on the hillsides. ###### v9 He gives food to the animals, and to the young ravens when they chirp. ###### v10 He is not enamored with the strength of a horse, nor is he impressed by the warrior's strong legs. ###### v11 The LORD takes delight in his faithful followers, and in those who wait for his loyal love. ###### v12 Extol the LORD, O Jerusalem. Praise your God, O Zion. ###### v13 For he makes the bars of your gates strong. He blesses your children within you. ###### v14 He brings peace to your territory. He abundantly provides for you the best grain. ###### v15 He sends his command through the earth; swiftly his order reaches its destination. ###### v16 He sends the snow that is white like wool; he spreads the frost that is white like ashes. ###### v17 He throws his hailstones like crumbs. Who can withstand the cold wind he sends? ###### v18 He then orders it all to melt; he breathes on it, and the water flows. ###### v19 He proclaims his word to Jacob, his statutes and regulations to Israel. ###### v20 He has not done so with any other nation; they are not aware of his regulations. Praise the LORD!
