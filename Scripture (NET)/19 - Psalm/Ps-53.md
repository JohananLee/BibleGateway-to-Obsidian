Psalm 53 ###### 1 Fools say to themselves, "There is no God." They sin and commit evil deeds; none of them does what is right. ###### v2 God looks down from heaven at the human race, to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God. ###### v3 Everyone rejects God; they are all morally corrupt. None of them does what is right, not even one! ###### v4 All those who behave wickedly do not understand-- those who devour my people as if they were eating bread, and do not call out to God. ###### v5 They are absolutely terrified, even by things that do not normally cause fear. For God annihilates those who attack you. You are able to humiliate them because God has rejected them. ###### v6 I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion! When God restores the well-being of his people, may Jacob rejoice, may Israel be happy!
