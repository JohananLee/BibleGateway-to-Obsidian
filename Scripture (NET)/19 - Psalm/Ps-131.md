Psalm 131 ###### 1 O LORD, my heart is not proud, nor do I have a haughty look. I do not have great aspirations, or concern myself with things that are beyond me. ###### v2 Indeed, I have calmed and quieted myself like a weaned child with its mother; I am content like a young child. ###### v3 O Israel, hope in the LORD now and forevermore!
