Psalm 52 ###### 1 Why do you boast about your evil plans, O powerful man? God's loyal love protects me all day long. ###### v2 Your tongue carries out your destructive plans; it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver. ###### v3 You love evil more than good, lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah) ###### v4 You love to use all the words that destroy, and the tongue that deceives. ###### v5 Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins. He will scoop you up and remove you from your home; he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah) ###### v6 When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe, and will mock the evildoer, saying: ###### v7 "Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector. He trusted in his great wealth and was confident about his plans to destroy others." ###### v8 But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I continually trust in God's loyal love. ###### v9 I will continually thank you when you execute judgment; I will rely on you, for your loyal followers know you are good.
