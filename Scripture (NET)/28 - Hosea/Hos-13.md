Baal Worshipers and Calf Worshipers to be Destroyed ###### 1 When Ephraim spoke, there was terror; he was exalted in Israel, but he became guilty by worshiping Baal and died. ###### v2 Even now they persist in sin! They make metal images for themselves, idols that they skillfully fashion from their own silver; all of them are nothing but the work of craftsmen. There is a saying about them: "Those who sacrifice to the calf idol are calf kissers!" ###### v3 Therefore they will disappear like the morning mist, like early morning dew that evaporates, like chaff that is blown away from a threshing floor, like smoke that disappears through an open window.Well-Fed Israel Will Be Fed to Wild Animals ###### v4 But I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt. Therefore, you must not acknowledge any God but me. Except for me there is no Savior. ###### v5 I cared for you in the wilderness, in the dry desert where no water was. ###### v6 When they were fed, they became satisfied; when they were satisfied, they became proud; as a result, they forgot me! ###### v7 So I will pounce on them like a lion; like a leopard I will lurk by the path. ###### v8 I will attack them like a bear robbed of her cubs-- I will rip open their chests. I will devour them there like a lion-- like a wild animal would tear them apart.Israel's King Unable to Deliver the Nation ###### v9 I will destroy you, O Israel! Who is there to help you? ###### v10 Where then is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? Where are your rulers for whom you asked, saying, "Give me a king and princes"? ###### v11 I granted you a king in my anger, and I will take him away in my wrath!Israel's Punishment Will Not Be Withheld Much Longer ###### v12 The punishment of Ephraim has been decreed; his punishment is being stored up for the future. ###### v13 The labor pains of a woman will overtake him, but the baby will lack wisdom; when the time arrives, he will not come out of the womb!The Lord Will Not Relent from the Threatened Judgment ###### v14 Will I deliver them from the power of Sheol? No, I will not! Will I redeem them from death? No, I will not! O Death, bring on your plagues! O Sheol, bring on your destruction! My eyes will not show any compassion!The Capital of the Northern Empire Will Be Destroyed ###### v15 Even though he flourishes like a reed plant, a scorching east wind will come, a wind from the LORD rising up from the desert. As a result, his spring will dry up; his well will become dry. That wind will spoil all his delightful foods in the containers in his storehouse. ###### v16 (14:1) Samaria will be held guilty, because she rebelled against her God. They will fall by the sword; their infants will be dashed to the ground-- their pregnant women will be ripped open.
