###### 1 Ephraim continually feeds on the wind; he chases the east wind all day; he multiplies lies and violence. They make treaties with Assyria, and send olive oil as tribute to Egypt. ###### v2 The LORD also has a covenant lawsuit against Judah; he will punish Jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds.Israel Must Return to the God of Jacob ###### v3 In the womb he attacked his brother; in his manly vigor he struggled with God. ###### v4 He struggled with an angel and prevailed; he wept and begged for his favor. He found God at Bethel, and there he spoke with him! ###### v5 As for the LORD God Almighty, the LORD is the name by which he is remembered! ###### v6 But you must return to your God, by maintaining love and justice and by waiting for your God to return to you.The Lord Refutes Israel's False Claim of Innocence ###### v7 The businessmen love to cheat; they use dishonest scales. ###### v8 Ephraim boasts, "I am very rich! I have become wealthy! In all that I have done to gain my wealth, no one can accuse me of any offense that is actually sinful." ###### v9 "I am the LORD your God who brought you out of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again as in the days of old. ###### v10 I spoke to the prophets; I myself revealed many visions; I spoke in parables through the prophets." ###### v11 Is there idolatry in Gilead? Certainly its inhabitants will come to nothing! Do they sacrifice bulls in Gilgal? Surely their altars will be like stones heaped up on a plowed field!Jacob in Aram, Israel in Egypt, and Ephraim in Trouble ###### v12 Jacob fled to the country of Aram, then Israel worked to acquire a wife; he tended sheep to pay for her. ###### v13 The LORD brought Israel out of Egypt by a prophet, and due to a prophet Israel was preserved alive. ###### v14 But Ephraim bitterly provoked him to anger; so he will hold him accountable for the blood he has shed, his Lord will repay him for the contempt he has shown.
