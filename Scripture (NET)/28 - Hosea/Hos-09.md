Fertility Cult Festivals Have Intoxicated Israel ###### 1 O Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly like the nations, for you are unfaithful to your God. You love to receive a prostitute's wages on all the floors where you thresh your grain. ###### v2 Threshing floors and wine vats will not feed the people, and new wine only deceives them.Assyrian Exile Will Reverse the Egyptian Exodus ###### v3 They will not remain in the LORD's land. Ephraim will return to Egypt; they will eat ritually unclean food in Assyria. ###### v4 They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD; they will not please him with their sacrifices. Their sacrifices will be like bread eaten while in mourning; all those who eat them will make themselves ritually unclean. For their bread will be only to satisfy their appetite; it will not come into the temple of the LORD. ###### v5 So what will you do on the festival day, on the festival days of the LORD?No Escape for the Israelites This Time ###### v6 Look! Even if they flee from the destruction, Egypt will take hold of them, and Memphis will bury them. The weeds will inherit the silver they treasure-- thorn bushes will occupy their homes. ###### v7 The time of judgment is about to arrive! The time of retribution is imminent! Israel will be humbled!Israel Rejects Hosea's Prophetic Exhortations The prophet is considered a fool-- the inspired man is viewed as a madman-- because of the multitude of your sins and your intense animosity. ###### v8 The prophet is a watchman over Ephraim on behalf of God, yet traps are laid for him along all his paths; animosity rages against him in the land of his God.The Best of Times, the Worst of Times ###### v9 They have sunk deep into corruption as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their wrongdoing. He will repay them for their sins. ###### v10 When I found Israel, it was like finding grapes in the wilderness. I viewed your ancestors like an early fig on a fig tree in its first season. Then they came to Baal Peor and they dedicated themselves to shame-- they became as detestable as what they loved.The Fertility Worshipers Will Become Infertile ###### v11 Ephraim will be like a bird; what they value will fly away. They will not bear children-- they will not enjoy pregnancy-- they will not even conceive! ###### v12 Even if they raise their children, I will take away every last one of them. Woe to them! For I will turn away from them. ###### v13 Ephraim, as I have seen, has given their children for prey; Ephraim will bear his sons for slaughter. ###### v14 Give them, O LORD-- what will you give them? Give them wombs that miscarry, and breasts that cannot nurse! ###### v15 Because of all their evil in Gilgal, I hate them there. On account of their evil deeds, I will drive them out of my land. I will no longer love them; all their rulers are rebels. ###### v16 Ephraim will be struck down-- their root will be dried up; they will not yield any fruit. Even if they do bear children, I will kill their precious offspring. ###### v17 My God will reject them, for they have not obeyed him; so they will be fugitives among the nations.
