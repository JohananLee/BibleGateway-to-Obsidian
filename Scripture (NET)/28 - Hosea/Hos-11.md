Reversal of the Exodus: Return to Egypt and Exile in Assyria ###### 1 "When Israel was a young man, I loved him like a son, and I summoned my son out of Egypt. ###### v2 But the more I summoned them, the farther they departed from me. They sacrificed to the Baal idols and burned incense to images. ###### v3 Yet it was I who led Ephraim; I took them by the arm, but they did not acknowledge that I had healed them. ###### v4 I drew them with leather cords, with straps of hide; I lifted the yoke from their neck, and gently fed them. ###### v5 They will return to Egypt! Assyria will rule over them because they refuse to repent! ###### v6 A sword will flash in their cities, it will destroy the bars of their city gates, and will devour them in their fortresses. ###### v7 My people are obsessed with turning away from me; they call to Baal, but he will never exalt them!The Divine Dilemma: Judgment or Mercy? ###### v8 "How can I give you up, O Ephraim? How can I surrender you, O Israel? How can I treat you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim? I have had a change of heart. All my tender compassions are aroused. ###### v9 I cannot carry out my fierce anger! I cannot totally destroy Ephraim! Because I am God, and not man--the Holy One among you-- I will not come in wrath!God Will Restore the Exiles to Israel ###### v10 "He will roar like a lion, and they will follow the LORD; when he roars, his children will come trembling from the west. ###### v11 They will return in fear and trembling like birds from Egypt, like doves from Assyria, and I will settle them in their homes," declares the LORD.God's Lawsuit against Israel: Breach of Covenant ###### v12 (12:1) Ephraim has surrounded me with lies; the house of Israel has surrounded me with deceit. But Judah still roams about with God; he remains faithful to the Holy One.
