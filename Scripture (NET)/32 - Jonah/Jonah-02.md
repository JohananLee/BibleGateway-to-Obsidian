###### 1 Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from the stomach of the fish ###### v2 and said, "I called out to the LORD from my distress, and he answered me; from the belly of Sheol I cried out for help, and you heard my prayer. ###### v3 You threw me into the deep waters, into the middle of the sea; the ocean current engulfed me; all the mighty waves you sent swept over me. ###### v4 I thought I had been banished from your sight and that I would never again see your holy temple. ###### v5 Water engulfed me up to my neck; the deep ocean surrounded me; seaweed was wrapped around my head. ###### v6 I went down to the very bottoms of the mountains; the gates of the netherworld barred me in forever, but you brought me up from the Pit, O LORD, my God. ###### v7 When my life was ebbing away, I called out to the LORD. And my prayer came to you, to your holy temple. ###### v8 Those who worship worthless idols forfeit the mercy that could be theirs. ###### v9 But as for me, I promise to offer a sacrifice to you with a public declaration of praise; I will surely do what I have promised. Salvation belongs to the LORD!" ###### v10 Then the LORD commanded the fish and it vomited Jonah out onto dry land.
