Introduction: God Has Spoken Fully and Finally in His Son ###### 1 After God spoke long ago in various portions and in various ways to our ancestors through the prophets, ###### v2 in these last days he has spoken to us in a son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he created the world. ###### v3 The Son is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, and he sustains all things by his powerful word, and so when he had accomplished cleansing for sins, _he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high_. ###### v4 Thus he became so far better than the angels as he has inherited a name superior to theirs.The Son Is Superior to Angels ###### v5 For to which of the angels did God ever say, "**_You are my son! Today I have fathered you_**"? And in another place he says, "**_I_** **_will be his father and he will be my son_**." ###### v6 But when he again brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "**_Let all the angels of God worship him!_**" ###### v7 And he says of the angels, "**_He makes_** **_his angels winds_** **_and his ministers a flame of fire_**," ###### v8 but of the Son he says, "_**Your throne, O God, is forever and ever**,_ **_and a righteous scepter_** **_is the scepter of your kingdom_**. ###### v9 **_You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness_**. **_So God, your God, has anointed you over your companions_** **_with the oil of rejoicing_**." ###### v10 And, "_**You founded the earth in the beginning, Lord**,_ **_and the heavens are the works of your hands_**. ###### v11 **_They will perish, but you continue_**. **_And they will all grow old like a garment_**, ###### v12 **_and like a robe you will fold them up_** **_and_** like a garment **_they will be changed,_** **_but you are the same and your years will never run out_**." ###### v13 But to which of the angels has he ever said, "**_Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet_**"? ###### v14 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to serve those who will inherit salvation?
