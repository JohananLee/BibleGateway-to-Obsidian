Jesus and Moses ###### 1 Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess, ###### v2 who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God's house. ###### v3 For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! ###### v4 For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. ###### v5 Now Moses was **_faithful_** **_in all God's_** **_house_** as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken. ###### v6 But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.Exposition of Psalm 95: Hearing God's Word in Faith ###### v7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "**_Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!_** ###### v8 "**_Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness_**. ###### v9 "_**There your fathers tested me and tried me**,_ **_and they saw my works for forty years_**. ###### v10 "**_Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said_**, '**_Their hearts are always wandering_** **_and they have not known my ways_**.' ###### v11 "**_As I swore in my anger_**, '**_They will never enter my rest!_**'" ###### v12 See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that forsakes the living God. ###### v13 But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called "Today," that none of you may become hardened by sin's deception. ###### v14 For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end. ###### v15 As it says, "**_Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!_** **_Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion_**." ###### v16 For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses' leadership? ###### v17 And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, _whose_ _dead bodies fell in the wilderness_? ###### v18 And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? ###### v19 So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.
