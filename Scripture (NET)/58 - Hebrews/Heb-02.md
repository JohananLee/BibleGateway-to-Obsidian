Warning Against Drifting Away ###### 1 Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. ###### v2 For if the message spoken through angels proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty, ###### v3 how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, ###### v4 while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.Exposition of Psalm 8: Jesus and the Destiny of Humanity ###### v5 For he did not put the world to come, about which we are speaking, under the control of angels. ###### v6 Instead someone testified somewhere: "**_What is man that you think of him_** **_or_ _the son of man that you care for him?_** ###### v7 **_You made him lower than the angels for a little while_**. **_You crowned him with glory and honor_**. ###### v8 **_You put all things under his control_**." For when he **_put_** **_all things under his control_**, he left nothing outside of his control. At present we do not yet see **_all things under his control_**, ###### v9 but we see Jesus, who was made **_lower than the angels for a little while_**, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God's grace he would experience death on behalf of everyone. ###### v10 For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. ###### v11 For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have the same origin, and so he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, ###### v12 saying, "**_I will proclaim your name to my brothers;_** **_in_ _the midst of the assembly I will praise you_**." ###### v13 Again he says, "I will be confident in him," and again, "_**Here I am**,_ **_with_** **_the children God has given me_**." ###### v14 Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he likewise shared in their humanity, so that through death he could destroy the one who holds the power of death (that is, the devil), ###### v15 and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. ###### v16 For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham's descendants. ###### v17 Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. ###### v18 For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
