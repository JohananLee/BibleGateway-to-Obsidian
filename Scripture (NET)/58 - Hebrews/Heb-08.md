The High Priest of a Better Covenant ###### 1 Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, one who _sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven_, ###### v2 a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up. ###### v3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer. ###### v4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. ###### v5 The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle. For he says, "**_See that you make everything according to the design_** **_shown_ _to you on the mountain_**." ###### v6 But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises. ###### v7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, no one would have looked for a second one. ###### v8 But showing its fault, God says to them, "**_Look, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah_**. ###### v9 "**_It will not be like the covenant_** **_that I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant and I had no regard for them, says the Lord_**. ###### v10 "_**For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord**. **I will put**_ **_my_ _laws in their minds_** _**and I will inscribe them on their hearts**. **And I will be their God and they will be my people**_. ###### v11 "**_And there will be no need at all_** **_for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying_**, '_**Know the Lord**,_' **_since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest_**. ###### v12 "**_For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will remember no longer_**." ###### v13 When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes the first obsolete. Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear.
