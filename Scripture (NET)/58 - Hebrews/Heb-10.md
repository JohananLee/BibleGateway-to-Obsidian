Concluding Exposition: Old and New Sacrifices Contrasted ###### 1 For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore completely unable, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to perfect those who come to worship. ###### v2 For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have no further consciousness of sin? ###### v3 But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year. ###### v4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. ###### v5 So when he came into the world, he said, "**_Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me_**. ###### v6 "**_Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in_**. ###### v7 "**_Then I said_**, '**_Here I am:_** **_I have come--it is written of me in the scroll of the book--to do your will, O God_**.'" ###### v8 When he says above, "**_Sacrifices and offerings_** and **_whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you did not desire nor did you take delight_** in them" (which are offered according to the law), ###### v9 then he says, "**_Here I am: I have come to do your will_**." He does away with the first to establish the second. ###### v10 By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. ###### v11 And every priest stands day after day serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again--sacrifices that can never take away sins. ###### v12 But when this priest had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, _he sat down at the right hand_ of God, ###### v13 where he is now waiting _until_ _his enemies are made a footstool for his feet_. ###### v14 For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy. ###### v15 And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us, for after saying, ###### v16 "_**This is the covenant that I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord**. **I will put**_ **_my_** **_laws on their hearts and I will inscribe them on their minds_**," ###### v17 then he says, "**_Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no longer_**." ###### v18 Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.Drawing Near to God in Enduring Faith ###### v19 Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, ###### v20 by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, ###### v21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, ###### v22 let us draw near with a sincere heart in the assurance that faith brings, because we have had our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water. ###### v23 And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess, for the one who made the promise is trustworthy. ###### v24 And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works, ###### v25 not abandoning our own meetings, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and even more so because you see the day drawing near. ###### v26 For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins is left for us, ###### v27 but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and _a fury_ _of fire that will consume God's enemies_. ###### v28 Someone who rejected the law of Moses was put to death without mercy _on the testimony of two or three witnesses_. ###### v29 How much greater punishment do you think that person deserves who has contempt for the Son of God, and profanes the blood of the covenant that made him holy, and insults the Spirit of grace? ###### v30 For we know the one who said, "**_Vengeance is mine, I will repay_**," and again, "**_The Lord will judge his people_**." ###### v31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God. ###### v32 But remember the former days when you endured a harsh conflict of suffering after you were enlightened. ###### v33 At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way. ###### v34 For in fact you shared the sufferings of those in prison, and you accepted the confiscation of your belongings with joy, because you knew that you certainly had a better and lasting possession. ###### v35 So do not throw away your confidence, because it has great reward. ###### v36 For you need endurance in order to do God's will and so receive what is promised. ###### v37 For **_just a little longer_** and **_he who is coming will arrive and not delay_**. ###### v38 **_But_** **_my righteous one will live by faith, and if he shrinks back, I_** **_take_** **_no pleasure in him_**. ###### v39 But we are not among those who shrink back and thus perish, but are among those who have faith and preserve their souls.
