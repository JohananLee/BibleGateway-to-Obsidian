The Nature of Melchizedek's Priesthood ###### 1 Now this **_Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings_** and **_blessed him_**. ###### v2 To him also **_Abraham apportioned a tithe_** **_of everything_**. His name first means king of righteousness, then **_king of Salem_**, that is, king of peace. ###### v3 Without father, without mother, without genealogy, he has neither beginning of days nor end of life but is like the son of God, and he remains a priest for all time. ###### v4 But see how great he must be, if Abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe of his plunder. ###### v5 And those of the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have authorization according to the law to collect a tithe from the people, that is, from their fellow countrymen, although they too are descendants of Abraham. ###### v6 But Melchizedek who does not share their ancestry collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who possessed the promise. ###### v7 Now without dispute the inferior is blessed by the superior, ###### v8 and in one case tithes are received by mortal men, while in the other by him who is affirmed to be alive. ###### v9 And it could be said that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid a tithe through Abraham. ###### v10 For he was still in his ancestor Abraham's loins when Melchizedek met him.Jesus and the Priesthood of Melchizedek ###### v11 So if perfection had in fact been possible through the Levitical priesthood--for on that basis the people received the law--what further need would there have been for another priest to arise, said to be in the order of Melchizedek and not in Aaron's order? ###### v12 For when the priesthood changes, a change in the law must come as well. ###### v13 Yet the one these things are spoken about belongs to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever officiated at the altar. ###### v14 For it is clear that our Lord is descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe. ###### v15 And this is even clearer if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, ###### v16 who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent but by the power of an indestructible life. ###### v17 For here is the testimony about him: "**_You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek_**." ###### v18 On the one hand a former command is set aside because it is weak and useless, ###### v19 for the law made nothing perfect. On the other hand a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. ###### v20 And since this was not done without a sworn affirmation--for the others have become priests without a sworn affirmation, ###### v21 but Jesus did so with a sworn affirmation by the one who said to him, "_**The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind**,_ '**_You are a priest forever_**'"-- ###### v22 accordingly Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. ###### v23 And the others who became priests were numerous, because death prevented them from continuing in office, ###### v24 but he holds his priesthood permanently since he lives forever. ###### v25 So he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. ###### v26 For it is indeed fitting for us to have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. ###### v27 He has no need to do every day what those priests do, to offer sacrifices first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people, since he did this in offering himself once for all. ###### v28 For the law appoints as high priests men subject to weakness, but the word of solemn affirmation that came after the law appoints a son made perfect forever.
