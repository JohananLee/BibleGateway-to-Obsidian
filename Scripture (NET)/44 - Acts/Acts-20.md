Paul Travels Through Macedonia and Greece ###### 1 After the disturbance had ended, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them and saying farewell, he left to go to Macedonia. ###### v2 After he had gone through those regions and spoken many words of encouragement to the believers there, he came to Greece, ###### v3 where he stayed for three months. Because the Jews had made a plot against him as he was intending to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. ###### v4 Paul was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, as well as Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. ###### v5 These had gone on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas. ###### v6 We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and within five days we came to the others in Troas, where we stayed for seven days. ###### v7 On the first day of the week, when we met to break bread, Paul began to speak to the people, and because he intended to leave the next day, he extended his message until midnight. ###### v8 (Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.) ###### v9 A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in the window, was sinking into a deep sleep while Paul continued to speak for a long time. Fast asleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. ###### v10 But Paul went down, threw himself on the young man, put his arms around him, and said, "Do not be distressed, for he is still alive!" ###### v11 Then Paul went back upstairs, and after he had broken bread and eaten, he talked with them a long time, until dawn. Then he left. ###### v12 They took the boy home alive and were greatly comforted.The Voyage to Miletus ###### v13 We went on ahead to the ship and put out to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had arranged it this way. He himself was intending to go there by land. ###### v14 When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene. ###### v15 We set sail from there, and on the following day we arrived off Chios. The next day we approached Samos, and the day after that we arrived at Miletus. ###### v16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so as not to spend time in the province of Asia, for he was hurrying to arrive in Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. ###### v17 From Miletus he sent a message to Ephesus, telling the elders of the church to come to him. ###### v18 When they arrived, he said to them, "You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I set foot in the province of Asia, ###### v19 serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, and with the trials that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews. ###### v20 You know that I did not hold back from proclaiming to you anything that would be helpful, and from teaching you publicly and from house to house, ###### v21 testifying to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. ###### v22 And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem without knowing what will happen to me there, ###### v23 except that the Holy Spirit warns me in town after town that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me. ###### v24 But I do not consider my life worth anything to myself, so that I may finish my task and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of God's grace. ###### v25 "And now I know that none of you among whom I went around proclaiming the kingdom will see me again. ###### v26 Therefore I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of you all. ###### v27 For I did not hold back from announcing to you the whole purpose of God. ###### v28 Watch out for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that he obtained with the blood of his own Son. ###### v29 I know that after I am gone fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. ###### v30 Even from among your own group men will arise, teaching perversions of the truth to draw the disciples away after them. ###### v31 Therefore be alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you with tears. ###### v32 And now I entrust you to God and to the message of his grace. This message is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. ###### v33 I have desired no one's silver or gold or clothing. ###### v34 You yourselves know that these hands of mine provided for my needs and the needs of those who were with me. ###### v35 By all these things, I have shown you that by working in this way we must help the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'" ###### v36 When he had said these things, he knelt down with them all and prayed. ###### v37 They all began to weep loudly, and hugged Paul and kissed him, ###### v38 especially saddened by what he had said, that they were not going to see him again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.
