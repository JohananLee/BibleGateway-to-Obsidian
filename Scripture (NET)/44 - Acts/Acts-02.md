The Holy Spirit and the Day of Pentecost ###### 1 Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. ###### v2 Suddenly a sound like a violent wind blowing came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting. ###### v3 And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them. ###### v4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them. ###### v5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem. ###### v6 When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. ###### v7 Completely baffled, they said, "Aren't all these who are speaking Galileans? ###### v8 And how is it that each one of us hears them in our own native language? ###### v9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia, ###### v10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, ###### v11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs--we hear them speaking in our own languages about the great deeds God has done!" ###### v12 All were astounded and greatly confused, saying to one another, "What does this mean?" ###### v13 But others jeered at the speakers, saying, "They are drunk on new wine!"Peter's Address on the Day of Pentecost ###### v14 But Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them: "You men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, know this and listen carefully to what I say. ###### v15 In spite of what you think, these men are not drunk, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning. ###### v16 But this is what was spoken about through the prophet Joel: ###### v17 '**_And_** in the last days **_it will be,_**' **_God_ _says,_** '**_that I will pour out my Spirit on all people,_** **_and your sons and your daughters will prophesy,_** **_and your young men will see visions,_** **_and your old men will dream dreams_**. ###### v18 **_Even on my servants,_** **_both_ _men and women,_** **_I will pour out my Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy_**. ###### v19 **_And I will perform wonders in the sky_** **_above_** **_and miraculous signs_** **_on_ _the earth below,_** **_blood and fire and clouds of smoke_**. ###### v20 **_The sun will be changed to darkness_** **_and the moon to blood_** **_before the great and glorious_** **_day of the Lord comes_**. ###### v21 **_And then_** **_everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved_**.' ###### v22 "Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man clearly attested to you by God with powerful deeds, wonders, and miraculous signs that God performed among you through him, just as you yourselves know-- ###### v23 this man, who was handed over by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you executed by nailing him to a cross at the hands of Gentiles. ###### v24 But God raised him up, having released him from the pains of death, because it was not possible for him to be held in its power. ###### v25 For David says about him, '**_I saw the Lord always in front of me,_** **_for he is at my right hand so that I will not be shaken_**. ###### v26 **_Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced;_** **_my body_** **_also_ _will live in hope,_** ###### v27 **_because you will not leave my soul in Hades,_** **_nor permit your Holy One to experience_** **_decay_**. ###### v28 **_You have made known to me the paths of life;_** **_you will make me full of joy with your presence_**.' ###### v29 "Brothers, I can speak confidently to you about our forefather David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. ###### v30 So then, because he was a prophet and knew that God _had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants_ _on_ _his throne_, ###### v31 David by foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that _he was neither abandoned to Hades_, nor did his body _experience_ _decay_. ###### v32 This Jesus God raised up, and we are all witnesses of it. ###### v33 So then, exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out what you both see and hear. ###### v34 For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says, '**_The Lord said to my lord,_** "**_Sit_** **_at_ _my right hand_** ###### v35 **_until I make your enemies a footstool_** **_for your feet_**."' ###### v36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt that God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ."The Response to Peter's Address ###### v37 Now when they heard this, they were acutely distressed and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "What should we do, brothers?" ###### v38 Peter said to them, "Repent, and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. ###### v39 For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God will call to himself." ###### v40 With many other words he testified and exhorted them saying, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation!" ###### v41 So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 people were added.The Fellowship of the Early Believers ###### v42 They were devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. ###### v43 Reverential awe came over everyone, and many wonders and miraculous signs came about by the apostles. ###### v44 All who believed were together and held everything in common, ###### v45 and they began selling their property and possessions and distributing the proceeds to everyone, as anyone had need. ###### v46 Every day they continued to gather together by common consent in the temple courts, breaking bread from house to house, sharing their food with glad and humble hearts, ###### v47 praising God and having the good will of all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number every day those who were being saved.
