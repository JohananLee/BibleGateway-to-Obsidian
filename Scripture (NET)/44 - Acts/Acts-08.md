Saul Begins to Persecute the Church Now on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were forced to scatter throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. ###### v2 Some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him. ###### v3 But Saul was trying to destroy the church; entering one house after another, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.Philip Preaches in Samaria ###### v4 Now those who had been forced to scatter went around proclaiming the good news of the word. ###### v5 Philip went down to the main city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them. ###### v6 The crowds were paying attention with one mind to what Philip said, as they heard and saw the miraculous signs he was performing. ###### v7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud shrieks, were coming out of many who were possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed. ###### v8 So there was great joy in that city. ###### v9 Now in that city was a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic and amazing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. ###### v10 All the people, from the least to the greatest, paid close attention to him, saying, "This man is the power of God that is called 'Great.'" ###### v11 And they paid close attention to him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. ###### v12 But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they began to be baptized, both men and women. ###### v13 Even Simon himself believed, and after he was baptized, he stayed close to Philip constantly, and when he saw the signs and great miracles that were occurring, he was amazed. ###### v14 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. ###### v15 These two went down and prayed for them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit. ###### v16 (For the Spirit had not yet come upon any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) ###### v17 Then Peter and John placed their hands on the Samaritans, and they received the Holy Spirit. ###### v18 Now Simon, when he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, offered them money, ###### v19 saying, "Give me this power too, so that everyone I place my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit." ###### v20 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could acquire God's gift with money! ###### v21 You have no share or part in this matter because your heart is not right before God! ###### v22 Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that he may perhaps forgive you for the intent of your heart. ###### v23 For I see that you are bitterly envious and in bondage to sin." ###### v24 But Simon replied, "You pray to the Lord for me so that nothing of what you have said may happen to me." ###### v25 So after Peter and John had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, proclaiming the good news to many Samaritan villages as they went.Philip and the Ethiopian Eunuch ###### v26 Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Get up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." (This is a desert road.) ###### v27 So he got up and went. There he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship, ###### v28 and was returning home, sitting in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah. ###### v29 Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go over and join this chariot." ###### v30 So Philip ran up to it and heard the man reading the prophet Isaiah. He asked him, "Do you understand what you're reading?" ###### v31 The man replied, "How in the world can I, unless someone guides me?" So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. ###### v32 Now the passage of scripture the man was reading was this: "**_He was led like a sheep to slaughter,_** **_and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,_** **_so he did_** **_not open his mouth_**. ###### v33 **_In humiliation_** **_justice was taken from him_**. **_Who can describe his posterity?_** **_For his life was taken away_** **_from the earth_**." ###### v34 Then the eunuch said to Philip, "Please tell me, who is the prophet saying this about--himself or someone else?" ###### v35 So Philip started speaking, and beginning with this scripture proclaimed the good news about Jesus to him. ###### v36 Now as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Look, there is water! What is to stop me from being baptized?" ###### v38 So he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. ###### v39 Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any more, but went on his way rejoicing. ###### v40 Philip, however, found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through the area, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
