Stephen's Defense Before the Council ###### 1 Then the high priest said, "Are these things true?" ###### v2 So he replied, "Brothers and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran, ###### v3 and said to him, '**_Go out from your country and from your relatives, and come to the land I will show you_**.' ###### v4 Then he went out from the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God made him move to this country where you now live. ###### v5 He did not give any of it to him for an inheritance, not even a foot of ground, yet God promised _to give it to him as his possession, and to his descendants after him_, even though Abraham as yet had no child. ###### v6 But God spoke as follows: 'Your **_descendants_** **_will be foreigners_** **_in_** **_a foreign country, whose citizens will enslave them and mistreat them for 400 years_**. ###### v7 **_But_** **_I will punish_** **_the nation they serve as slaves_**,' said God, '**_and_** **_after these things they will come out of there_** and _worship_ _me_ _in this place_.' ###### v8 Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and so he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him when he was eight days old, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs. ###### v9 The patriarchs, because they were jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him, ###### v10 and rescued him from all his troubles, and granted him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. ###### v11 Then a famine occurred throughout Egypt and Canaan, causing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. ###### v12 So when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there the first time. ###### v13 On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers again, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh. ###### v14 So Joseph sent a message and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come, seventy-five people in all. ###### v15 So Jacob went down to Egypt and died there, along with our ancestors, ###### v16 and their bones were later moved to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a certain sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. ###### v17 "But as the time drew near for God to fulfill the promise he had declared to Abraham, the people increased greatly in number in Egypt, ###### v18 until **_another_** **_king who did not know about_** **_Joseph_** **_ruled_** **_over Egypt_**. ###### v19 This was the one who exploited our people and was cruel to our ancestors, forcing them to abandon their infants so they would die. ###### v20 At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God. For three months he was brought up in his father's house, ###### v21 and when he had been abandoned, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. ###### v22 So Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds. ###### v23 But when he was about forty years old, it entered his mind to visit his fellow countrymen the Israelites. ###### v24 When he saw one of them being hurt unfairly, Moses came to his defense and avenged the person who was mistreated by striking down the Egyptian. ###### v25 He thought his own people would understand that God was delivering them through him, but they did not understand. ###### v26 The next day Moses saw two men fighting, and tried to make peace between them, saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why are you hurting one another?' ###### v27 But the man who was unfairly hurting his neighbor pushed Moses aside, saying, '**_Who made_** **_you_** **_a ruler and judge over us?_** ###### v28 **_You_** **_don't want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?_**' ###### v29 When the man said this, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. ###### v30 "After forty years had passed, _an angel appeared to him in the desert_ _of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush_. ###### v31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and when he approached to investigate, there came the voice of the Lord, ###### v32 '**_I am the God of your forefathers,_** **_the God of Abraham, Isaac,_** **_and Jacob_**.' Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look more closely. ###### v33 **_But_** **_the Lord said to him,_** '**_Take the sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground_**. ###### v34 **_I have certainly seen the suffering_** **_of my people who are in Egypt and_ _have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them_**. **_Now_** **_come, I will send you to Egypt_**.' ###### v35 This same Moses they had rejected, saying, '**_Who made you a ruler and judge?_**' God sent as both ruler and deliverer through the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. ###### v36 This man led them out, performing wonders and miraculous signs in the land of Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. ###### v37 This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, '**_God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers_**.' ###### v38 This is the man who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and he received living oracles to give to you. ###### v39 Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him, but pushed him aside and turned back to Egypt in their hearts, ###### v40 saying to Aaron, '**_Make us gods who will go in front of us, for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt_** **_--we do not know what has happened to him!_**' ###### v41 At that time they made an idol in the form of a calf, brought a sacrifice to the idol, and began rejoicing in the works of their hands. ###### v42 But God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: '**_It was not to me that you offered slain animals and sacrifices_** **_forty_** **_years in the wilderness, was it,_** **_house_ _of Israel?_** ###### v43 **_But_ _you took along the tabernacle_** **_of Moloch_** **_and_ _the star of the_** **_god_ _Rephan,_** **_the images you made to worship, but I will deport_** **_you_ _beyond Babylon_**.' ###### v44 Our ancestors had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as God who spoke to Moses ordered him to make it according to the design he had seen. ###### v45 Our ancestors received possession of it and brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors, until the time of David. ###### v46 He found favor with God and asked that he could find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob. ###### v47 But Solomon built a house for him. ###### v48 Yet the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands, as the prophet says, ###### v49 '**_Heaven is my throne,_** **_and earth is the footstool for my feet_**. **_What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord,_** **_or what is my resting place?_** ###### v50 **_Did my hand_** **_not_ _make all these things?_**' ###### v51 "You stubborn people, with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always resisting the Holy Spirit, like your ancestors did! ###### v52 Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold long ago the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become! ###### v53 You received the law by decrees given by angels, but you did not obey it."Stephen is Killed ###### v54 When they heard these things, they became furious and ground their teeth at him. ###### v55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently toward heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. ###### v56 "Look!" he said. "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!" ###### v57 But they covered their ears, shouting out with a loud voice, and rushed at him with one intent. ###### v58 When they had driven him out of the city, they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. ###### v59 They continued to stone Stephen while he prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!" ###### v60 Then he fell to his knees and cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them!" When he had said this, he died.
