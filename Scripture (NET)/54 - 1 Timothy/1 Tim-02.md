Prayer for All People ###### 1 First of all, then, I urge that requests, prayers, intercessions, and thanks be offered on behalf of all people, ###### v2 even for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. ###### v3 Such prayer for all is good and welcomed before God our Savior, ###### v4 since he wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. ###### v5 For there is one God and one intermediary between God and humanity, Christ Jesus, himself human, ###### v6 who gave himself as a ransom for all, revealing God's purpose at his appointed time. ###### v7 For this I was appointed a preacher and apostle--I am telling the truth; I am not lying--and a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth. ###### v8 So I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or dispute.Conduct of Women ###### v9 Likewise the women are to dress in suitable apparel, with modesty and self-control. Their adornment must not be with braided hair and gold or pearls or expensive clothing, ###### v10 but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess reverence for God. ###### v11 A woman must learn quietly with all submissiveness. ###### v12 But I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man. She must remain quiet. ###### v13 For Adam was formed first and then Eve. ###### v14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, because she was fully deceived, fell into transgression. ###### v15 But she will be delivered through childbearing, if she continues in faith and love and holiness with self-control.
