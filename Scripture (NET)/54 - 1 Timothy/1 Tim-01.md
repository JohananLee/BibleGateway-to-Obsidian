Salutation ###### 1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, ###### v2 to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!Timothy's Task in Ephesus ###### v3 As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay on in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to spread false teachings, ###### v4 nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies. Such things promote useless speculations rather than God's redemptive plan that operates by faith. ###### v5 But the aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. ###### v6 Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion. ###### v7 They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently. ###### v8 But we know that the law is good if someone uses it legitimately, ###### v9 realizing that law is not intended for a righteous person, but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, ###### v10 sexually immoral people, practicing homosexuals, kidnappers, liars, perjurers--in fact, for any who live contrary to sound teaching. ###### v11 This accords with the glorious gospel of the blessed God that was entrusted to me. ###### v12 I am grateful to the one who has strengthened me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he considered me faithful in putting me into ministry, ###### v13 even though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor, and an arrogant man. But I was treated with mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief, ###### v14 and our Lord's grace was abundant, bringing faith and love in Christ Jesus. ###### v15 This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance: "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners"--and I am the worst of them! ###### v16 But here is why I was treated with mercy: so that in me as the worst, Christ Jesus could demonstrate his utmost patience, as an example for those who are going to believe in him for eternal life. ###### v17 Now to the eternal king, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen. ###### v18 I put this charge before you, Timothy my child, in keeping with the prophecies once spoken about you, in order that with such encouragement you may fight the good fight. ###### v19 To do this you must hold firmly to faith and a good conscience, which some have rejected and so have suffered shipwreck in regard to the faith. ###### v20 Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme.
