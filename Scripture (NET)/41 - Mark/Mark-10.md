Divorce ###### 1 Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan River. Again crowds gathered to him, and again, as was his custom, he taught them. ###### v2 Then some Pharisees came, and to test him they asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" ###### v3 He answered them, "What did Moses command you?" ###### v4 They said, "Moses permitted a man _to write **a certificate of dismissal** and to divorce_ her." ###### v5 But Jesus said to them, "He wrote this commandment for you because of your hard hearts. ###### v6 But from the beginning of creation **_he_** **_made_ _them male and female_**. ###### v7 **_For_** **_this reason a man will leave his father and mother,_** ###### v8 **_and_** **_the two will become one flesh_**. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. ###### v9 Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." ###### v10 In the house once again, the disciples asked him about this. ###### v11 So he told them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. ###### v12 And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery."Jesus and Little Children ###### v13 Now people were bringing little children to him for him to touch, but the disciples scolded those who brought them. ###### v14 But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, "Let the little children come to me and do not try to stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these. ###### v15 I tell you the truth, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child will never enter it." ###### v16 After he took the children in his arms, he placed his hands on them and blessed them.The Rich Man ###### v17 Now as Jesus was starting out on his way, someone ran up to him, fell on his knees, and said, "Good teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" ###### v18 Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. ###### v19 You know the commandments: '**_Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not give false testimony,_** _do not defraud,** honor your father and mother**_.'" ###### v20 The man said to him, "Teacher, I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth." ###### v21 As Jesus looked at him, he felt love for him and said, "You lack one thing. Go, sell whatever you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me." ###### v22 But at this statement, the man looked sad and went away sorrowful, for he was very rich. ###### v23 Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!" ###### v24 The disciples were astonished at these words. But again Jesus said to them, "Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! ###### v25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God." ###### v26 They were even more astonished and said to one another, "Then who can be saved?" ###### v27 Jesus looked at them and replied, "This is impossible for mere humans, but not for God; all things are possible for God." ###### v28 Peter began to speak to him, "Look, we have left everything to follow you!" ###### v29 Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, there is no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the gospel ###### v30 who will not receive in this age a hundred times as much--homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, fields, all with persecutions--and in the age to come, eternal life. ###### v31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first."Third Prediction of Jesus' Death and Resurrection ###### v32 They were on the way, going up to Jerusalem. Jesus was going ahead of them, and they were amazed, but those who followed were afraid. He took the twelve aside again and began to tell them what was going to happen to him. ###### v33 "Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and experts in the law. They will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the Gentiles. ###### v34 They will mock him, spit on him, flog him severely, and kill him. Yet after three days, he will rise again."The Request of James and John ###### v35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him and said, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask." ###### v36 He said to them, "What do you want me to do for you?" ###### v37 They said to him, "Permit one of us to sit at your right hand and the other at your left in your glory." ###### v38 But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I experience?" ###### v39 They said to him, "We are able." Then Jesus said to them, "You will drink the cup I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism I experience, ###### v40 but to sit at my right or at my left is not mine to give. It is for those for whom it has been prepared." ###### v41 Now when the other ten heard this, they became angry with James and John. ###### v42 Jesus called them and said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those in high positions use their authority over them. ###### v43 But it is not this way among you. Instead whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant, ###### v44 and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of all. ###### v45 For even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many."Healing Blind Bartimaeus ###### v46 They came to Jericho. As Jesus and his disciples and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, a blind beggar, was sitting by the road. ###### v47 When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!" ###### v48 Many scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted all the more, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" ###### v49 Jesus stopped and said, "Call him." So they called the blind man and said to him, "Have courage! Get up! He is calling you." ###### v50 He threw off his cloak, jumped up, and came to Jesus. ###### v51 Then Jesus said to him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man replied, "Rabbi, let me see again." ###### v52 Jesus said to him, "Go, your faith has healed you." Immediately he regained his sight and followed him on the road.
