Breaking Human Traditions ###### 1 Now the Pharisees and some of the experts in the law who came from Jerusalem gathered around him. ###### v2 And they saw that some of Jesus' disciples ate their bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed. ###### v3 (For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they perform a ritual washing, holding fast to the tradition of the elders. ###### v4 And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. They hold fast to many other traditions: the washing of cups, pots, kettles, and dining couches.) ###### v5 The Pharisees and the experts in the law asked him, "Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?" ###### v6 He said to them, "Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written: '**_This people honors me with their lips,_** **_but their heart_** **_is far from me_**. ###### v7 **_They worship me in vain,_** **_teaching as doctrine the commandments of men_**.' ###### v8 Having no regard for the command of God, you hold fast to human tradition." ###### v9 He also said to them, "You neatly reject the commandment of God in order to set up your tradition. ###### v10 For Moses said, '**_Honor your father and your mother_**,' and, '**_Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death_**.' ###### v11 But you say that if anyone tells his father or mother, 'Whatever help you would have received from me is _corban_' (that is, a gift for God), ###### v12 then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother. ###### v13 Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like this." ###### v14 Then he called the crowd again and said to them, "Listen to me, everyone, and understand. ###### v15 There is nothing outside of a person that can defile him by going into him. Rather, it is what comes out of a person that defiles him." ###### v17 Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. ###### v18 He said to them, "Are you so foolish? Don't you understand that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him? ###### v19 For it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the sewer." (This means all foods are clean.) ###### v20 He said, "What comes out of a person defiles him. ###### v21 For from within, out of the human heart, come evil ideas, sexual immorality, theft, murder, ###### v22 adultery, greed, evil, deceit, debauchery, envy, slander, pride, and folly. ###### v23 All these evils come from within and defile a person."A Syrophoenician Woman's Faith ###### v24 After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but he was not able to escape notice. ###### v25 Instead, a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell at his feet. ###### v26 The woman was a Greek, of Syrophoenician origin. She asked him to cast the demon out of her daughter. ###### v27 He said to her, "Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and to throw it to the dogs." ###### v28 She answered, "Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs." ###### v29 Then he said to her, "Because you said this, you may go. The demon has left your daughter." ###### v30 She went home and found the child lying on the bed, and the demon gone.Healing a Deaf Mute ###### v31 Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis. ###### v32 They brought to him a deaf man who had difficulty speaking, and they asked him to place his hands on him. ###### v33 After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers in the man's ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue. ###### v34 Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh, "_Ephphatha_" (that is, "Be opened"). ###### v35 And immediately the man's ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly. ###### v36 Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone. But as much as he ordered them not to do this, they proclaimed it all the more. ###### v37 People were completely astounded and said, "He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak."
