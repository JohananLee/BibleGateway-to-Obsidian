The Resurrection ###### 1 Now after the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. ###### v2 Suddenly there was a severe earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descending from heaven came and rolled away the stone and sat on it. ###### v3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. ###### v4 The guards were shaken and became like dead men because they were so afraid of him. ###### v5 But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. ###### v6 He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying. ###### v7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, 'He has been raised from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.' Listen, I have told you!" ###### v8 So they left the tomb quickly, with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. ###### v9 But Jesus met them, saying, "Greetings!" They came to him, held on to his feet and worshiped him. ###### v10 Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee. They will see me there."The Guards' Report ###### v11 While they were going, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened. ###### v12 After they had assembled with the elders and formed a plan, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, ###### v13 telling them, "You are to say, 'His disciples came at night and stole his body while we were asleep.' ###### v14 If this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble." ###### v15 So they took the money and did as they were instructed. And this story is told among the Jews to this day.The Great Commission ###### v16 So the eleven disciples went to Galilee to the mountain Jesus had designated. ###### v17 When they saw him, they worshiped him, but some doubted. ###### v18 Then Jesus came up and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ###### v19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, ###### v20 teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
