The Plot Against Jesus ###### 1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples, ###### v2 "You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified." ###### v3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people met together in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas. ###### v4 They planned to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. ###### v5 But they said, "Not during the feast, so that there won't be a riot among the people."Jesus' Anointing ###### v6 Now while Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, ###### v7 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfumed oil, and she poured it on his head as he was at the table. ###### v8 When the disciples saw this, they became indignant and said, "Why this waste? ###### v9 It could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor!" ###### v10 When Jesus learned of this, he said to them, "Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a good service for me. ###### v11 For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me! ###### v12 When she poured this oil on my body, she did it to prepare me for burial. ###### v13 I tell you the truth, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her."The Plan to Betray Jesus ###### v14 Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests ###### v15 and said, "What will you give me to betray him into your hands?" So they set out thirty silver coins for him. ###### v16 From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray him.The Passover ###### v17 Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?" ###### v18 He said, "Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will observe the Passover with my disciples at your house."'" ###### v19 So the disciples did as Jesus had instructed them, and they prepared the Passover. ###### v20 When it was evening, he took his place at the table with the twelve. ###### v21 And while they were eating he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me." ###### v22 They became greatly distressed and each one began to say to him, "Surely not I, Lord?" ###### v23 He answered, "The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me. ###### v24 The Son of Man will go as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if he had never been born." ###### v25 Then Judas, the one who would betray him, said, "Surely not I, Rabbi?" Jesus replied, "You have said it yourself."The Lord's Supper ###### v26 While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it, gave it to his disciples, and said, "Take, eat, this is my body." ###### v27 And after taking the cup and giving thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you, ###### v28 for this is my blood, the blood of the covenant, that is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. ###### v29 I tell you, from now on I will not drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom." ###### v30 After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.The Prediction of Peter's Denial ###### v31 Then Jesus said to them, "This night you will all fall away because of me, for it is written: '**_I will strike the shepherd,_** **_and the sheep of the flock will be scattered_.**' ###### v32 But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." ###### v33 Peter said to him, "If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!" ###### v34 Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth, on this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." ###### v35 Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will never deny you." And all the disciples said the same thing.Gethsemane ###### v36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go over there and pray." ###### v37 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and became anguished and distressed. ###### v38 Then he said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me." ###### v39 Going a little farther, he threw himself down with his face to the ground and prayed, "My Father, if possible, let this cup pass from me! Yet not what I will, but what you will." ###### v40 Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, "So, couldn't you stay awake with me for one hour? ###### v41 Stay awake and pray that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." ###### v42 He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will must be done." ###### v43 He came again and found them sleeping; they could not keep their eyes open. ###### v44 So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing once more. ###### v45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ###### v46 Get up, let us go. Look! My betrayer is approaching!"Betrayal and Arrest ###### v47 While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people. ###### v48 (Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him!") ###### v49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi," and kissed him. ###### v50 Jesus said to him, "Friend, do what you are here to do." Then they came and took hold of Jesus and arrested him. ###### v51 But one of those with Jesus grabbed his sword, drew it out, and struck the high priest's slave, cutting off his ear. ###### v52 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place! For all who take hold of the sword will die by the sword. ###### v53 Or do you think that I cannot call on my Father, and that he would send me more than twelve legions of angels right now? ###### v54 How then would the scriptures that say it must happen this way be fulfilled?" ###### v55 At that moment Jesus said to the crowd, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me like you would an outlaw? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me. ###### v56 But this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled." Then all the disciples left him and fled.Condemned by the Sanhedrin ###### v57 Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house the experts in the law and the elders had gathered. ###### v58 But Peter was following him from a distance, all the way to the high priest's courtyard. After going in, he sat with the guards to see the outcome. ###### v59 The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death. ###### v60 But they did not find anything, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward ###### v61 and declared, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'" ###### v62 So the high priest stood up and said to him, "Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?" ###### v63 But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God." ###### v64 Jesus said to him, "You have said it yourself. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man _sitting_ _at the right hand_ of the Power and _coming_ _on the clouds of heaven_." ###### v65 Then the high priest tore his clothes and declared, "He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Now you have heard the blasphemy! ###### v66 What is your verdict?" They answered, "He is guilty and deserves death." ###### v67 Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. And some slapped him, ###### v68 saying, "Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who hit you?"Peter's Denials ###### v69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A slave girl came to him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean." ###### v70 But he denied it in front of them all: "I don't know what you're talking about!" ###### v71 When he went out to the gateway, another slave girl saw him and said to the people there, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene." ###### v72 He denied it again with an oath, "I do not know the man!" ###### v73 After a little while, those standing there came up to Peter and said, "You really are one of them too--even your accent gives you away!" ###### v74 At that he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, "I do not know the man!" At that moment a rooster crowed. ###### v75 Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly.
