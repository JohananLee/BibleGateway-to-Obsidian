Cleansing a Leper ###### 1 After he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him. ###### v2 And a leper approached and bowed low before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean." ###### v3 He stretched out his hand and touched him saying, "I am willing. Be clean!" Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ###### v4 Then Jesus said to him, "See that you do not speak to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."Healing the Centurion's Servant ###### v5 When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came to him asking for help: ###### v6 "Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible anguish." ###### v7 Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him." ###### v8 But the centurion replied, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof! Instead, just say the word and my servant will be healed. ###### v9 For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I say to this one, 'Go!' and he goes, and to another 'Come!' and he comes, and to my slave 'Do this!' and he does it." ###### v10 When Jesus heard this he was amazed and said to those who followed him, "I tell you the truth, I have not found such faith in anyone in Israel! ###### v11 I tell you, many will come from the east and west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, ###### v12 but the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth." ###### v13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; just as you believed, it will be done for you." And the servant was healed at that hour.Healings at Peter's House ###### v14 Now when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down, sick with a fever. ###### v15 He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve them. ###### v16 When it was evening, many demon-possessed people were brought to him. He drove out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick. ###### v17 In this way what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah was fulfilled: "**_He took our weaknesses and carried our diseases_**."Challenging Professed Followers ###### v18 Now when Jesus saw a large crowd around him, he gave orders to go to the other side of the lake. ###### v19 Then an expert in the law came to him and said, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." ###### v20 Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens, and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head." ###### v21 Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father." ###### v22 But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."Stilling of a Storm ###### v23 As he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. ###### v24 And a great storm developed on the sea so that the waves began to swamp the boat. But he was asleep. ###### v25 So they came and woke him up saying, "Lord, save us! We are about to die!" ###### v26 But he said to them, "Why are you cowardly, you people of little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was dead calm. ###### v27 And the men were amazed and said, "What sort of person is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!"Healing the Gadarene Demoniacs ###### v28 When he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs met him. They were extremely violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way. ###### v29 They cried out, "Son of God, leave us alone! Have you come here to torment us before the time?" ###### v30 A large herd of pigs was feeding some distance from them. ###### v31 Then the demons begged him, "If you drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs." ###### v32 And he said, "Go!" So they came out and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned in the water. ###### v33 The herdsmen ran off, went into the town, and told everything that had happened to the demon-possessed men. ###### v34 Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
