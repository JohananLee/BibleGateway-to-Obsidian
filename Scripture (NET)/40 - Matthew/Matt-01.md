David was the father of Solomon (by the wife of Uriah), ###### v7 Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, Abijah the father of Asa, ###### v8 Asa the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, Joram the father of Uzziah, ###### v9 Uzziah the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, ###### v10 Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah, ###### v11 and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. ###### v12 After the deportation to Babylon, Jeconiah became the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, ###### v13 Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, Eliakim the father of Azor, ###### v14 Azor the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, Achim the father of Eliud, ###### v15 Eliud the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob, ###### v16 and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. ###### v17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon, fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to Christ, fourteen generations.The Birth of Jesus Christ ###### v18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. ###### v19 Because Joseph, her husband to be, was a righteous man, and because he did not want to disgrace her, he intended to divorce her privately. ###### v20 When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. ###### v21 She will give birth to a son and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." ###### v22 This all happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled: ###### v23 "_**Look! The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and** they **will name him**_ **_Emmanuel_**," which means "**_God with us_**." ###### v24 When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife, ###### v25 but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.
