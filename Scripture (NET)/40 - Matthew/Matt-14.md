The Death of John the Baptist ###### 1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus, ###### v2 and he said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead! And because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him." ###### v3 For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, ###### v4 because John had repeatedly told him, "It is not lawful for you to have her." ###### v5 Although Herod wanted to kill John, he feared the crowd because they accepted John as a prophet. ###### v6 But on Herod's birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod, ###### v7 so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. ###### v8 Instructed by her mother, she said, "Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter." ###### v9 Although it grieved the king, because of his oath and the dinner guests he commanded it to be given. ###### v10 So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. ###### v11 His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. ###### v12 Then John's disciples came and took the body and buried it and went and told Jesus.The Feeding of the Five Thousand ###### v13 Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to an isolated place. But when the crowd heard about it, they followed him on foot from the towns. ###### v14 As he got out he saw the large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. ###### v15 When evening arrived, his disciples came to him saying, "This is an isolated place and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves." ###### v16 But he replied, "They don't need to go. You give them something to eat." ###### v17 They said to him, "We have here only five loaves and two fish." ###### v18 "Bring them here to me," he replied. ###### v19 Then he instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds. ###### v20 They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, twelve baskets full. ###### v21 Not counting women and children, there were about 5,000 men who ate.Walking on Water ###### v22 Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dispersed the crowds. ###### v23 And after he sent the crowds away, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. ###### v24 Meanwhile the boat, already far from land, was taking a beating from the waves because the wind was against it. ###### v25 As the night was ending, Jesus came to them walking on the sea. ###### v26 When the disciples saw him walking on the water they were terrified and said, "It's a ghost!" and cried out with fear. ###### v27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them: "Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid." ###### v28 Peter said to him, "Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you on the water." ###### v29 So he said, "Come." Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. ###### v30 But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid. And starting to sink, he cried out, "Lord, save me!" ###### v31 Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?" ###### v32 When they went up into the boat, the wind ceased. ###### v33 Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God." ###### v34 After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. ###### v35 When the people there recognized him, they sent word into all the surrounding area, and they brought all their sick to him. ###### v36 They begged him if they could only touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.
