Judah Takes the Lead ###### 1 After Joshua died, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Who should lead the invasion against the Canaanites and launch the attack?" ###### v2 The LORD said, "The men of Judah should take the lead. Be sure of this! I am handing the land over to them." ###### v3 The men of Judah said to their relatives, the men of Simeon, "Invade our allotted land with us and help us attack the Canaanites. Then we will go with you into your allotted land." So the men of Simeon went with them. ###### v4 The men of Judah attacked, and the LORD handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them. They killed 10,000 men at Bezek. ###### v5 They met Adoni-Bezek at Bezek and fought him. They defeated the Canaanites and Perizzites. ###### v6 When Adoni-Bezek ran away, they chased him and captured him. Then they cut off his thumbs and big toes. ###### v7 Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, with thumbs and big toes cut off, used to lick up food scraps under my table. God has repaid me for what I did to them." They brought him to Jerusalem, where he died. ###### v8 The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They put the sword to it and set the city on fire. ###### v9 Later the men of Judah went down to attack the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the foothills. ###### v10 The men of Judah attacked the Canaanites living in Hebron. (Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba.) They killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. ###### v11 From there they attacked the people of Debir. (Debir used to be called Kiriath Sepher.) ###### v12 Caleb said, "To the man who attacks and captures Kiriath Sepher I will give my daughter Achsah as a wife." ###### v13 When Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, captured it, Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. ###### v14 One time Achsah came and charmed her father so she could ask him for some land. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb said to her, "What would you like?" ###### v15 She answered, "Please give me a special present. Since you have given me land in the Negev, now give me springs of water." So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs. ###### v16 Now the descendants of the Kenite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of date palm trees to Arad in the wilderness of Judah, located in the Negev. They went and lived with the people of Judah. ###### v17 The men of Judah went with their brothers the men of Simeon and defeated the Canaanites living in Zephath. They wiped out Zephath. So people now call the city Hormah. ###### v18 The men of Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, and the territory surrounding each of these cities. ###### v19 The LORD was with the men of Judah. They conquered the hill country, but they could not conquer the people living in the coastal plain, because they had chariots with iron-rimmed wheels. ###### v20 Caleb received Hebron, just as Moses had promised. He drove out the three Anakites. ###### v21 The men of Benjamin, however, did not conquer the Jebusites living in Jerusalem. The Jebusites live with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this very day.Partial Success ###### v22 When the men of Joseph attacked Bethel, the LORD was with them. ###### v23 When the men of Joseph spied out Bethel (it used to be called Luz), ###### v24 the spies spotted a man leaving the city. They said to him, "If you show us a secret entrance into the city, we will reward you." ###### v25 He showed them a secret entrance into the city, and they put the city to the sword. But they let the man and his extended family leave safely. ###### v26 He moved to Hittite country and built a city. He named it Luz, and it has kept that name to this very day. ###### v27 The men of Manasseh did not conquer Beth Shean, Taanach, or their surrounding towns. Nor did they conquer the people living in Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo or their surrounding towns. The Canaanites managed to remain in those areas. ###### v28 Whenever Israel was strong militarily, they forced the Canaanites to do hard labor, but they never totally conquered them. ###### v29 The men of Ephraim did not conquer the Canaanites living in Gezer. The Canaanites lived among them in Gezer. ###### v30 The men of Zebulun did not conquer the people living in Kitron and Nahalol. The Canaanites lived among them and were forced to do hard labor. ###### v31 The men of Asher did not conquer the people living in Acco or Sidon, nor did they conquer Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphek, or Rehob. ###### v32 The people of Asher live among the Canaanites residing in the land because they did not conquer them. ###### v33 The men of Naphtali did not conquer the people living in Beth Shemesh or Beth Anath. They live among the Canaanites residing in the land. The Canaanites living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were forced to do hard labor for them. ###### v34 The Amorites forced the people of Dan to live in the hill country. They did not allow them to live in the coastal plain. ###### v35 The Amorites managed to remain in Har Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. Whenever the tribe of Joseph was strong militarily, the Amorites were forced to do hard labor. ###### v36 The border of Amorite territory ran from the Scorpion Ascent to Sela and on up.
