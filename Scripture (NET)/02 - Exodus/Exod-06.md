I will bring you out from your enslavement to the Egyptians, I will rescue you from the hard labor they impose, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments. ###### v7 I will take you to myself for a people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from your enslavement to the Egyptians. ###### v8 I will bring you to the land I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob--and I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD.'" ###### v9 Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and hard labor. ###### v10 Then the LORD said to Moses, ###### v11 "Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt that he must release the Israelites from his land." ###### v12 But Moses replied to the LORD, "If the Israelites did not listen to me, then how will Pharaoh listen to me, since I speak with difficulty?" ###### v13 The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge for the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.The Ancestry of Moses and Aaron ###### v14 These were the heads of their fathers' households: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn son of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
