The Making of the Priestly Garments ###### 1 From the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn they made woven garments for serving in the sanctuary; they made holy garments that were for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.The Ephod ###### v2 He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet yarn, and fine twisted linen. ###### v3 They hammered the gold into thin sheets and cut it into narrow strips to weave them into the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and into the fine linen, the work of an artistic designer. ###### v4 They made shoulder pieces for it, attached to two of its corners, so it could be joined together. ###### v5 The artistically woven waistband of the ephod that was on it was like it, of one piece with it, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. ###### v6 They set the onyx stones in gold filigree settings, engraved as with the engravings of a seal with the names of the sons of Israel. ###### v7 He put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as stones of memorial for the Israelites, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.The Breastpiece of Decision ###### v8 He made the breastpiece, the work of an artistic designer, in the same fashion as the ephod, of gold, blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and fine twisted linen. ###### v9 It was square--they made the breastpiece doubled, nine inches long and nine inches wide when doubled. ###### v10 They set on it four rows of stones: a row with a ruby, a topaz, and a beryl--the first row; ###### v11 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and an emerald; ###### v12 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; ###### v13 and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper. They were enclosed in gold filigree settings. ###### v14 The stones were for the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, corresponding to the number of their names. Each name corresponding to one of the twelve tribes was like the engravings of a seal. ###### v15 They made for the breastpiece braided chains like cords of pure gold, ###### v16 and they made two gold filigree settings and two gold rings, and they attached the two rings to the upper two ends of the breastpiece. ###### v17 They attached the two gold chains to the two rings at the ends of the breastpiece; ###### v18 the other two ends of the two chains they attached to the two settings, and they attached them to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. ###### v19 They made two rings of gold and put them on the other two ends of the breastpiece on its edge, which is on the inner side of the ephod. ###### v20 They made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces on the front of the ephod, close to the juncture above the waistband of the ephod. ###### v21 They tied the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod by blue cord, so that it was above the waistband of the ephod, so that the breastpiece would not be loose from the ephod, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.The Other Garments ###### v22 He made the robe of the ephod completely blue, the work of a weaver. ###### v23 There was an opening in the center of the robe, like the opening of a collar, with an edge all around the opening so that it could not be torn. ###### v24 They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn and twisted linen around the hem of the robe. ###### v25 They made bells of pure gold and attached the bells between the pomegranates around the hem of the robe between the pomegranates. ###### v26 There was a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all around the hem of the robe, to be used in ministering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. ###### v27 They made tunics of fine linen--the work of a weaver, for Aaron and for his sons-- ###### v28 and the turban of fine linen, the headbands of fine linen, and the undergarments of fine twisted linen. ###### v29 The sash was of fine twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of an embroiderer, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. ###### v30 They made a plate, the holy diadem, of pure gold and wrote on it an inscription, as on the engravings of a seal, "Holiness to the LORD." ###### v31 They attached to it a blue cord to attach it to the turban above, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.Moses Inspects the Tabernacle ###### v32 So all the work of the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, was completed, and the Israelites did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses--they did it exactly so. ###### v33 They brought the tabernacle to Moses, the tent and all its furnishings, clasps, frames, bars, posts, and bases; ###### v34 and the coverings of ram skins dyed red, the covering of fine leather, and the protecting curtain; ###### v35 the ark of the testimony and its poles, and the atonement lid; ###### v36 the table, all its utensils, and the Bread of the Presence; ###### v37 the pure lampstand, its lamps, with the lamps set in order, and all its accessories, and oil for the light; ###### v38 and the gold altar, and the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense; and the curtain for the entrance to the tent; ###### v39 the bronze altar and its bronze grating, its poles, and all its utensils; the large basin with its pedestal; ###### v40 the hangings of the courtyard, its posts and its bases, and the curtain for the gateway of the courtyard, its ropes and its tent pegs, and all the furnishings for the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting; ###### v41 the woven garments for serving in the sanctuary, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to minister as priests. ###### v42 The Israelites did all the work according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses. ###### v43 Moses inspected all the work, and they had done it just as the LORD had commanded--they had done it exactly--and Moses blessed them.
