Willing Artisans ###### 1 The LORD spoke to Moses, ###### v2 "See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, ###### v3 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God in skill, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship, ###### v4 to make artistic designs for work with gold, with silver, and with bronze, ###### v5 and with cutting and setting stone, and with cutting wood, to work in all kinds of craftsmanship. ###### v6 Moreover, I have also given him Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, and I have given ability to all the specially skilled, that they may make everything I have commanded you: ###### v7 the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the atonement lid that is on it, all the furnishings of the tent, ###### v8 the table with its utensils, the pure lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense, ###### v9 the altar for the burnt offering with all its utensils, the large basin with its base, ###### v10 the woven garments, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons, to minister as priests, ###### v11 the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the Holy Place. They will make all these things just as I have commanded you."Sabbath Observance ###### v12 The LORD said to Moses, ###### v13 "Tell the Israelites, 'Surely you must keep my Sabbaths, for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you. ###### v14 So you must keep the Sabbath, for it is holy for you. Everyone who defiles it must surely be put to death; indeed, if anyone does any work on it, then that person will be cut off from among his people. ###### v15 Six days work may be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD; anyone who does work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death. ###### v16 The Israelites must keep the Sabbath by observing the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant. ###### v17 It is a sign between me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'" ###### v18 He gave Moses two tablets of testimony when he had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, tablets of stone written by the finger of God.
