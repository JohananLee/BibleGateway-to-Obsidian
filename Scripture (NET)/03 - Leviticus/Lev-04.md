They must bring it before the Meeting Tent, ###### v15 the elders of the congregation must lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD, and someone must slaughter the bull before the LORD. ###### v16 Then the high priest must bring some of the blood of the bull to the Meeting Tent, ###### v17 and that priest must dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of the blood seven times before the LORD toward the front of the curtain. ###### v18 He must put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD in the Meeting Tent, and all the rest of the blood he must pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering that is at the entrance of the Meeting Tent. ###### v19 "'Then the priest must take all its fat and offer the fat up in smoke on the altar. ###### v20 He must do with the rest of the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; this is what he must do with it.

So the priest will make atonement on his behalf for his sin and he will be forgiven.For the Common Person ###### v27 "'If an ordinary individual sins by straying unintentionally when he violates one of the LORD's commandments which must not be violated, and he pleads guilty, ###### v28 or his sin that he committed is made known to him, he must bring a flawless female goat as his offering for the sin that he committed. ###### v29 He must lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter the sin offering in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. ###### v30 Then the priest must take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he must pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. ###### v31 Then he must remove all of its fat (just as fat was removed from the peace-offering sacrifice) and the priest must offer it up in smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma to the LORD. So the priest will make atonement on his behalf and he will be forgiven. ###### v32 "'But if he brings a sheep as his offering, for a sin offering, he must bring a flawless female. ###### v33 He must lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slaughter it for a sin offering in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. ###### v34 Then the priest must take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and he must pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. ###### v35 Then the one who brought the offering must remove all its fat (just as the fat of the sheep is removed from the peace-offering sacrifice) and the priest must offer them up in smoke on the altar on top of the other gifts for the LORD. So the priest will make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has committed and he will be forgiven.
