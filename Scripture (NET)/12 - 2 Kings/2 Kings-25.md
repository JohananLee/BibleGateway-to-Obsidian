They took the bronze to Babylon. ###### v14 They also took the pots, shovels, trimming shears, pans, and all the bronze utensils used by the priests. ###### v15 The captain of the royal guard took the golden and silver censers and basins. ###### v16 The bronze of the items that King Solomon made for the LORD's temple--including the two pillars, the big bronze basin called "The Sea," the twelve bronze bulls under "The Sea," and the movable stands--was too heavy to be weighed. ###### v17 Each of the pillars was about twenty-seven feet high. The bronze top of one pillar was about 4½ feet high and had bronze latticework and pomegranate-shaped ornaments all around it. The second pillar with its latticework was like it. ###### v18 The captain of the royal guard took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the priest who was second in rank, and the three doorkeepers. ###### v19 From the city he took a eunuch who was in charge of the soldiers, five of the king's advisers who were discovered in the city, an official army secretary who drafted citizens for military service, and sixty citizens from the people of the land who were discovered in the city. ###### v20 Nebuzaradan, captain of the royal guard, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. ###### v21 The king of Babylon ordered them to be executed at Riblah in the territory of Hamath. So Judah was deported from its land.Gedaliah Appointed Governor ###### v22 Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over the people whom he allowed to remain in the land of Judah. ###### v23 All the officers of the Judahite army and their troops heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah to govern. So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The officers who came were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite. ###### v24 Gedaliah took an oath so as to give them and their troops some assurance of safety. He said, "You don't need to be afraid to submit to the Babylonian officials. Settle down in the land and submit to the king of Babylon. Then things will go well for you." ###### v25 But in the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family, came with ten of his men and murdered Gedaliah, as well as the Judeans and Babylonians who were with him at Mizpah. ###### v26 Then all the people, from the youngest to the oldest, as well as the army officers, left for Egypt, because they were afraid of what the Babylonians might do.Jehoiachin in Babylon ###### v27 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, King Evil Merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison. ###### v28 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prestigious position than the other kings who were with him in Babylon. ###### v29 Jehoiachin took off his prison clothes and ate daily in the king's presence for the rest of his life. ###### v30 He was given daily provisions by the king for the rest of his life until the day he died.
