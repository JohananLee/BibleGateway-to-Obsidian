You and the resident foreigner will be alike before the LORD. ###### v16 One law and one custom must apply to you and to the resident foreigner who lives alongside you.'"Rules for Firstfruits ###### v17 The LORD spoke to Moses: ###### v18 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them, 'When you enter the land to which I am bringing you ###### v19 and you eat some of the food of the land, you must offer up a raised offering to the LORD. ###### v20 You must offer up a cake of the first of your finely ground flour as a raised offering; as you offer the raised offering of the threshing floor, so you must offer it up. ###### v21 You must give to the LORD some of the first of your finely ground flour as a raised offering in your future generations.Rules for Unintentional Offenses ###### v22 "'If you sin unintentionally and do not observe all these commandments that the LORD has spoken to Moses-- ###### v23 all that the LORD has commanded you by the authority of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses and continuing through your future generations-- ###### v24 then if anything is done unintentionally without the knowledge of the community, the whole community must prepare one young bull for a burnt offering--for a pleasing aroma to the LORD--along with its grain offering and its customary drink offering, and one male goat for a purification offering. ###### v25 And the priest is to make atonement for the whole community of the Israelites, and they will be forgiven, because it was unintentional and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire to the LORD, and their purification offering before the LORD, for their unintentional offense. ###### v26 And the whole community of the Israelites and the resident foreigner who lives among them will be forgiven, since all the people were involved in the unintentional offense. ###### v27 "'If any person sins unintentionally, then he must bring a yearling female goat for a purification offering. ###### v28 And the priest must make atonement for the person who sins unintentionally--when he sins unintentionally before the LORD--to make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven. ###### v29 You must have one law for the person who sins unintentionally, both for the native-born among the Israelites and for the resident foreigner who lives among them.Deliberate Sin ###### v30 "'But the person who acts defiantly, whether native-born or a resident foreigner, insults the LORD. That person must be cut off from among his people. ###### v31 Because he has despised the LORD's message and has broken his commandment, that person must be completely cut off. His iniquity will be on him.'" ###### v32 When the Israelites were in the wilderness they found a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day. ###### v33 Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to the whole community. ###### v34 They put him in custody, because there was no clear instruction about what should be done to him. ###### v35 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must surely be put to death; the whole community must stone him with stones outside the camp." ###### v36 So the whole community took him outside the camp and stoned him to death, just as the LORD commanded Moses.Rules for Tassels ###### v37 The LORD spoke to Moses: ###### v38 "Speak to the Israelites and tell them to make tassels for themselves on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and put a blue thread on the tassel of the corners. ###### v39 You must have this tassel so that you may look at it and remember all the commandments of the LORD and obey them and so that you do not follow after your own heart and your own eyes that lead you to unfaithfulness. ###### v40 Thus you will remember and obey all my commandments and be holy to your God. ###### v41 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God."
