The Leader's Offerings ###### 1 When Moses had completed setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings, and he anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils. ###### v2 Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their clans, made an offering. They were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who had been supervising the numbering. ###### v3 They brought their offerings before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen--one cart for every two of the leaders, and an ox for each one; and they presented them in front of the tabernacle.The Distribution of the Gifts ###### v4 Then the LORD spoke to Moses: ###### v5 "Receive these gifts from them, that they may be used in doing the work of the tent of meeting; and you must give them to the Levites, to every man as his service requires." ###### v6 So Moses accepted the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites. ###### v7 He gave two carts and four oxen to the Gershonites, as their service required; ###### v8 and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the Merarites, as their service required, under the authority of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest. ###### v9 But to the Kohathites he gave none, because the service of the holy things, which they carried on their shoulders, was their responsibility.The Time of Presentation ###### v10 The leaders offered gifts for the dedication of the altar when it was anointed.
