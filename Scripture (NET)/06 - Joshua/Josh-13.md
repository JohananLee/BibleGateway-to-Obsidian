The Lord Speaks to Joshua ###### 1 When Joshua was very old, the LORD told him, "You are very old, and a great deal of land remains to be conquered. ###### v2 This is the land that remains: all the territory of the Philistines and all the Geshurites, ###### v3 from the Shihor River east of Egypt northward to the territory of Ekron (it is regarded as Canaanite territory), including the area belonging to the five Philistine lords who ruled in Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as Avvite land ###### v4 to the south; all the Canaanite territory, from Arah in the region of Sidon to Aphek, as far as Amorite territory; ###### v5 the territory of Byblos and all Lebanon to the east, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath. ###### v6 I will drive out before the Israelites all who live in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, all the Sidonians; you be sure to parcel it out to Israel as I instructed you. ###### v7 Now, divide up this land among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."Tribal Lands East of the Jordan ###### v8 The other half of Manasseh, Reuben, and Gad received their allotted tribal lands on east side of the Jordan, just as Moses, the LORD's servant, had assigned them. ###### v9 Their territory started from Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley), included the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plain of Medeba as far as Dibon, ###### v10 and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon, and ended at the Ammonite border. ###### v11 Their territory also included Gilead, Geshurite and Maacathite territory, all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah-- ###### v12 the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was one of the few remaining Rephaites.) Moses defeated them and took their lands. ###### v13 But the Israelites did not conquer the Geshurites and Maacathites; Geshur and Maacah live among Israel to this very day. ###### v14 However, Moses did not assign land as an inheritance to the Levites; their inheritance is the sacrificial offerings made to the LORD God of Israel, as he instructed them. ###### v15 Moses assigned land to the tribe of Reuben by its clans. ###### v16 Their territory started at Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and included the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plain of Medeba, ###### v17 Heshbon and all its surrounding cities on the plain, including Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baal Meon, ###### v18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, ###### v19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley, ###### v20 Beth Peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth. ###### v21 It encompassed all the cities of the plain and the whole realm of King Sihon of the Amorites who ruled in Heshbon. Moses defeated him and the Midianite leaders Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba (they were subjects of Sihon and lived in his territory). ###### v22 The Israelites killed Balaam son of Beor, the omen reader, along with the others. ###### v23 The border of the tribe of Reuben was the Jordan. The land allotted to the tribe of Reuben by its clans included these cities and their towns. ###### v24 Moses assigned land to the tribe of Gad by its clans. ###### v25 Their territory included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, and half the Ammonite territory as far as Aroer near Rabbah. ###### v26 Their territory ran from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Debir. ###### v27 It included the valley of Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Sukkoth, and Zaphon, and the rest of the realm of King Sihon of Heshbon, the area east of the Jordan to the end of the Sea of Kinnereth. ###### v28 The land allotted to the tribe of Gad by its clans included these cities and their towns. ###### v29 Moses assigned land to the half-tribe of Manasseh by its clans. ###### v30 Their territory started at Mahanaim and encompassed all Bashan, the whole realm of King Og of Bashan, including all sixty cities in Havvoth Jair in Bashan. ###### v31 Half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities in the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were assigned to the descendants of Makir son of Manasseh, to half the descendants of Makir by their clans. ###### v32 These are the land assignments made by Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab east of the Jordan River opposite Jericho. ###### v33 However, Moses did not assign land as an inheritance to the Levites; their inheritance is the LORD God of Israel, as he instructed them.
