Salutation ###### 1 From Paul, an apostle (not from men, nor by human agency, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised him from the dead) ###### v2 and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia. ###### v3 Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, ###### v4 who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father, ###### v5 to whom be glory forever and ever! Amen.Occasion of the Letter ###### v6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of Christ and are following a different gospel-- ###### v7 not that there really is another gospel, but there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ. ###### v8 But even if we (or an angel from heaven) should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be condemned to hell! ###### v9 As we have said before, and now I say again, if any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let him be condemned to hell! ###### v10 Am I now trying to gain the approval of people, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ!Paul's Vindication of His Apostleship ###### v11 Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. ###### v12 For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source; instead I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ. ###### v13 For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I was savagely persecuting the church of God and trying to destroy it. ###### v14 I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. ###### v15 But when the one who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased ###### v16 to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach him among the Gentiles, I did not go to ask advice from any human being, ###### v17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, but right away I departed to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus. ###### v18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and get information from him, and I stayed with him fifteen days. ###### v19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother. ###### v20 I assure you that, before God, I am not lying about what I am writing to you! ###### v21 Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. ###### v22 But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. ###### v23 They were only hearing, "The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy." ###### v24 So they glorified God because of me.
