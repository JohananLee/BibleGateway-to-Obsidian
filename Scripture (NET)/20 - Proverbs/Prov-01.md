Introduction to the Book ###### 1 The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: ###### v2 To learn wisdom and moral instruction, to discern wise counsel. ###### v3 To receive moral instruction in skillful living, with righteousness, justice, and equity. ###### v4 To impart shrewdness to the morally naive, a discerning plan to the young person. ###### v5 (Let the wise also hear and gain instruction, and let the discerning acquire guidance!) ###### v6 To discern the meaning of a proverb and a parable, the sayings of the wise and their riddles.Introduction to the Theme of the Book ###### v7 Fearing the LORD is the beginning of discernment, but fools have despised wisdom and moral instruction. ###### v8 Listen, my child, to the instruction from your father, and do not forsake the teaching from your mother. ###### v9 For they will be like an elegant garland on your head, and like pendants around your neck.Admonition to Avoid Easy but Unjust Riches ###### v10 My child, if sinners try to entice you, do not consent! ###### v11 If they say, "Come with us! We will lie in wait to shed blood; we will ambush an innocent person capriciously. ###### v12 We will swallow them alive like Sheol, those full of vigor like those going down to the Pit. ###### v13 We will seize all kinds of precious wealth; we will fill our houses with plunder. ###### v14 Join with us! We will all share equally in what we steal." ###### v15 My child, do not go down their way, withhold yourself from their path; ###### v16 for they are eager to inflict harm, and they hasten to shed blood. ###### v17 Surely it is futile to spread a net in plain sight of any bird, ###### v18 but these men lie in wait for their own blood, they ambush their own lives! ###### v19 Such are the ways of all who gain profit unjustly; it takes away the life of those who obtain it!Warning Against Disregarding Wisdom ###### v20 Wisdom calls out in the street, she shouts loudly in the plazas; ###### v21 at the head of the noisy streets she calls, in the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her words: ###### v22 "How long will you simpletons love naiveté? How long have mockers delighted in mockery? And how long will fools hate knowledge? ###### v23 You should respond to my rebuke. Then I would pour out my thoughts to you; I would make my words known to you. ###### v24 However, because I called but you refused to listen, because I stretched out my hand but no one was paying attention, ###### v25 and you neglected all my advice, and did not comply with my rebuke, ###### v26 so I myself will laugh when disaster strikes you, I will mock when what you dread comes, ###### v27 when what you dread comes like a whirlwind, and disaster strikes you like a devastating storm, when distressing trouble comes on you. ###### v28 Then they will call to me, but I will not answer; they will diligently seek me, but they will not find me. ###### v29 Because they hated moral knowledge, and did not choose to fear the LORD, ###### v30 they did not comply with my advice, they spurned all my rebuke. ###### v31 Therefore they will eat from the fruit of their way, and they will be stuffed full of their own counsel. ###### v32 For the waywardness of the simpletons will kill them, and the careless ease of fools will destroy them. ###### v33 But the one who listens to me will live in security, and will be at ease from the dread of harm."
