###### 1 The wicked person fled, though no one was pursuing, but the righteous person can be as confident as a lion. ###### v2 When a country is rebellious it has many princes, but by someone who is discerning and knowledgeable order is maintained. ###### v3 A poor person who oppresses the weak is like a driving rain without food. ###### v4 Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law contend with them. ###### v5 Evil people do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD understand it all. ###### v6 A poor person who walks in his integrity is better than one who is perverse in his ways even though he is rich. ###### v7 The one who keeps the law is a discerning child, but a companion of gluttons brings shame to his parents. ###### v8 The one who increases his wealth by increasing interest gathers it for someone who is gracious to the needy. ###### v9 The one who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. ###### v10 The one who leads the upright astray in an evil way will himself fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit what is good. ###### v11 A rich person is wise in his own opinion, but a discerning poor person can evaluate him properly. ###### v12 When the righteous rejoice, great is the glory, but when the wicked rise to power, people are sought out. ###### v13 The one who covers his transgressions will not prosper, but whoever confesses them and forsakes them will find mercy. ###### v14 Blessed is the one who is always cautious, but whoever hardens his heart will fall into evil. ###### v15 Like a roaring lion or a roving bear, so is a wicked ruler over a poor people. ###### v16 The prince who is a great oppressor lacks wisdom, but the one who hates unjust gain will prolong his days. ###### v17 The one who is tormented by the murder of another will flee to the pit; let no one support him. ###### v18 The one who walks blamelessly will be delivered, but whoever is perverse in his ways will fall at once. ###### v19 The one who works his land will be satisfied with food, but whoever chases daydreams will have his fill of poverty. ###### v20 A faithful person will have an abundance of blessings, but the one who hastens to gain riches will not go unpunished. ###### v21 To show partiality is terrible, for a person will transgress over the smallest piece of bread. ###### v22 The stingy person hastens after riches and does not know that poverty will overtake him. ###### v23 The one who reproves another will in the end find more favor than the one who flatters with the tongue. ###### v24 The one who robs his father and mother and says, "There is no transgression," is a companion to the one who destroys. ###### v25 The greedy person stirs up dissension, but the one who trusts in the LORD will prosper. ###### v26 The one who trusts in his own heart is a fool, but the one who walks in wisdom will escape. ###### v27 The one who gives to the poor will not lack, but whoever shuts his eyes to them will receive many curses. ###### v28 When the wicked gain control, people hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous increase.
