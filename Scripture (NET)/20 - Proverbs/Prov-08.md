The Appeal of Wisdom ###### 1 Does not wisdom call out? Does not understanding raise her voice? ###### v2 At the top of the prominent places along the way, at the intersection of the paths she has taken her stand; ###### v3 beside the gates opening into the city, at the entrance of the doorways she cries out: ###### v4 "To you, O people, I call out, and my voice calls to all mankind. ###### v5 You who are naive, discern wisdom! And you fools, understand discernment! ###### v6 Listen, for I will speak excellent things, and my lips will utter what is right. ###### v7 For my mouth speaks truth, and my lips hate wickedness. ###### v8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing in them twisted or crooked. ###### v9 All of them are clear to the discerning and upright to those who find knowledge. ###### v10 Receive my instruction rather than silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold. ###### v11 For wisdom is better than rubies, and desirable things cannot be compared to her. ###### v12 "I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. ###### v13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; I hate arrogant pride and the evil way and perverse utterances. ###### v14 Counsel and sound wisdom belong to me; I possess understanding and might. ###### v15 By me kings reign, and by me potentates decree righteousness; ###### v16 by me princes rule, as well as nobles and all righteous judges. ###### v17 I will love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently will find me. ###### v18 Riches and honor are with me, long-lasting wealth and righteousness. ###### v19 My fruit is better than the purest gold, and my harvest is better than choice silver. ###### v20 I walk in the path of righteousness, in the pathway of justice, ###### v21 that I may cause those who love me to inherit wealth, and that I may fill their treasuries. ###### v22 The LORD created me as the beginning of his works, before his deeds of long ago. ###### v23 From eternity I have been fashioned, from the beginning, from before the world existed. ###### v24 When there were no deep oceans I was born, when there were no springs overflowing with water; ###### v25 before the mountains were set in place-- before the hills--I was born, ###### v26 before he made the earth and its fields, or the top soil of the world. ###### v27 When he established the heavens, I was there; when he marked out the horizon over the face of the deep, ###### v28 when he established the clouds above, when he secured the fountains of the deep, ###### v29 when he gave the sea his decree that the waters should not pass over his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, ###### v30 then I was beside him as a master craftsman, and I was his delight day by day, rejoicing before him at all times, ###### v31 rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and delighting in its people. ###### v32 "So now, children, listen to me; blessed are those who keep my ways. ###### v33 Listen to my instruction so that you may be wise, and do not neglect it. ###### v34 Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching at my doors day by day, waiting beside my doorway. ###### v35 For the one who finds me has found life and received favor from the LORD. ###### v36 But the one who misses me brings harm to himself; all who hate me love death."
