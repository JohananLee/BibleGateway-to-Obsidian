###### 1 When you sit down to eat with a ruler, consider carefully what is before you, ###### v2 and put a knife to your throat if you possess a large appetite. ###### v3 Do not crave that ruler's delicacies, for that food is deceptive. ###### v4 Do not wear yourself out to become rich; be wise enough to restrain yourself. ###### v5 When you gaze upon riches, they are gone, for they surely make wings for themselves, and fly off into the sky like an eagle! ###### v6 Do not eat the food of a stingy person, do not crave his delicacies; ###### v7 for he is like someone who has calculated the cost in his mind. "Eat and drink," he says to you, but his heart is not with you; ###### v8 you will vomit up the little bit you have eaten, and will have wasted your pleasant words. ###### v9 Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words. ###### v10 Do not move an ancient boundary stone, or take over the fields of the fatherless, ###### v11 for their Protector is strong; he will plead their case against you. ###### v12 Apply your heart to instruction and your ears to the words of knowledge. ###### v13 Do not withhold discipline from a child; even if you strike him with the rod, he will not die. ###### v14 If you strike him with the rod, you will deliver him from death. ###### v15 My child, if your heart is wise, then my heart also will be glad; ###### v16 my soul will rejoice when your lips speak what is right. ###### v17 Do not let your heart envy sinners, but rather be zealous in fearing the LORD all the time. ###### v18 For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. ###### v19 Listen, my child, and be wise, and guide your heart on the right way. ###### v20 Do not spend time among drunkards, among those who eat too much meat, ###### v21 because drunkards and gluttons become impoverished, and drowsiness clothes them with rags. ###### v22 Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. ###### v23 Acquire truth and do not sell it-- wisdom, and discipline, and understanding. ###### v24 The father of a righteous person will rejoice greatly; whoever fathers a wise child will have joy in him. ###### v25 May your father and your mother have joy; may she who bore you rejoice. ###### v26 Give me your heart, my son, and let your eyes observe my ways; ###### v27 for a prostitute is like a deep pit; a harlot is like a narrow well. ###### v28 Indeed, she lies in wait like a robber, and increases the unfaithful among men. ###### v29 Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has contentions? Who has complaints? Who has wounds without cause? Who has dullness of the eyes? ###### v30 Those who linger over wine, those who go looking for mixed wine. ###### v31 Do not look on the wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup, when it goes down smoothly. ###### v32 Afterward it bites like a snake, and stings like a viper. ###### v33 Your eyes will see strange things, and your mind will speak perverse things. ###### v34 And you will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, and like one who lies down on the top of the rigging. ###### v35 You will say, "They have struck me, but I am not harmed! They beat me, but I did not know it! When will I awake? I will look for another drink."
