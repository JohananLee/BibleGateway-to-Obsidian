###### 1 A good name is to be chosen rather than great wealth, good favor more than silver or gold. ###### v2 The rich and the poor are met together; the LORD is the Creator of them both. ###### v3 A shrewd person saw danger and hid himself, but the naive passed on by and paid for it. ###### v4 The reward for humility and fearing the LORD is riches and honor and life. ###### v5 Thorns and snares are in the path of the perverse, but the one who guards himself keeps far from them. ###### v6 Train a child in the way that he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it. ###### v7 The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender. ###### v8 The one who sows iniquity will reap trouble, and the rod of his fury will end. ###### v9 A generous person will be blessed, for he has given some of his food to the poor. ###### v10 Drive out the scorner and contention will leave; strife and insults will cease. ###### v11 The one who loves a pure heart and whose speech is gracious--the king will be his friend. ###### v12 The eyes of the LORD watched over a cause, and subverted the words of the treacherous person. ###### v13 The sluggard has said, "There is a lion outside! I will be killed in the middle of the streets!" ###### v14 The mouth of an adulteress is like a deep pit; the one against whom the LORD is angry will fall into it. ###### v15 Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him. ###### v16 The one who oppresses the poor to increase his own gain and the one who gives to the rich--both end up only in poverty.The Sayings of the Wise ###### v17 Incline your ear and listen to the words of the wise, and apply your mind to my instruction. ###### v18 For it is pleasing if you keep these sayings within you, and they are ready on your lips. ###### v19 So that your confidence may be in the LORD, I hereby make them known to you today--even you. ###### v20 Have I not written thirty sayings for you, sayings of counsel and knowledge, ###### v21 to show you true and reliable words, so that you may give accurate answers to those who sent you? ###### v22 Do not exploit a poor person because he is poor and do not crush the needy in court, ###### v23 for the LORD will plead their case and will rob the life of those who are robbing them. ###### v24 Do not make friends with an angry person, and do not associate with a wrathful person, ###### v25 lest you learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare. ###### v26 Do not be one who strikes hands in pledge or who puts up security for debts. ###### v27 If you do not have enough to pay, your bed will be taken right out from under you! ###### v28 Do not move an ancient boundary stone that was put in place by your ancestors. ###### v29 You have seen a person skilled in his work-- he will take his position before kings; he will not take his position before obscure people.
