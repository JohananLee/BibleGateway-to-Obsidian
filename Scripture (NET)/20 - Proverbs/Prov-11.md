###### 1 The LORD abhors dishonest scales, but an accurate weight is his delight. ###### v2 After pride came, disgrace followed; but wisdom came with humility. ###### v3 The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them. ###### v4 Wealth does not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. ###### v5 The righteousness of the blameless will make their way smooth, but the wicked will fall through their own wickedness. ###### v6 The righteousness of the upright will deliver them, but the treacherous will be ensnared by their own desires. ###### v7 When a wicked person dies, his expectation perishes, and hope based on power has perished. ###### v8 A righteous person was delivered out of trouble, then a wicked person took his place. ###### v9 With his speech the godless person destroys his neighbor, but by knowledge the righteous will be delivered. ###### v10 When the righteous do well, the city rejoices; when the wicked perish, there is joy. ###### v11 A city is exalted by the blessing provided from the upright, but it is destroyed by the counsel of the wicked. ###### v12 The one who denounces his neighbor lacks sense, but a discerning person keeps silent. ###### v13 The one who goes about slandering others reveals secrets, but the one who is trustworthy conceals a matter. ###### v14 When there is no guidance a nation falls, but there is success in the abundance of counselors. ###### v15 The one who has put up security for a stranger will surely have trouble, but whoever avoids shaking hands is secure. ###### v16 A generous woman gains honor, and ruthless men seize wealth. ###### v17 A kind person benefits himself, but a cruel person brings himself trouble. ###### v18 The wicked person earns deceitful wages, but the one who sows righteousness reaps a genuine reward. ###### v19 True righteousness leads to life, but the one who pursues evil pursues it to his own death. ###### v20 The LORD abhors those who are perverse in heart, but those who are blameless in their ways are his delight. ###### v21 Be assured that the evil person will not be unpunished, but the descendants of the righteous have escaped harm. ###### v22 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman who rejects discretion. ###### v23 The desire of the righteous is only good, but the expectation of the wicked is wrath. ###### v24 One person is generous and yet grows more wealthy, but another withholds more than he should and comes to poverty. ###### v25 A generous person will be enriched, and the one who provides water for others will himself be satisfied. ###### v26 People will curse the one who withholds grain, but they will praise the one who sells it. ###### v27 The one who diligently seeks good seeks favor, but the one who searches for evil--it will come to him. ###### v28 The one who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf. ###### v29 The one who troubles his family will inherit nothing, and the fool will be a servant to the wise person. ###### v30 The fruit of the righteous is like a tree producing life, and the one who wins souls is wise. ###### v31 If the righteous are recompensed on earth, how much more the wicked sinner!
