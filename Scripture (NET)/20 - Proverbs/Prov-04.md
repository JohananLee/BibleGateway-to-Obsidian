Admonition to Follow Righteousness and Avoid Wickedness ###### 1 Listen, children, to a father's instruction, and pay attention so that you may gain discernment. ###### v2 Because I hereby give you good instruction, do not forsake my teaching. ###### v3 When I was a son to my father, a tender, only child before my mother, ###### v4 he taught me, and he said to me: "Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands so that you will live. ###### v5 Acquire wisdom, acquire understanding; do not forget and do not turn aside from the words I speak. ###### v6 Do not forsake wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will guard you. ###### v7 Wisdom is supreme--so acquire wisdom, and whatever you acquire, acquire understanding! ###### v8 Esteem her highly and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her. ###### v9 She will place a fair garland on your head; she will bestow a beautiful crown on you." ###### v10 Listen, my child, and accept my words, so that the years of your life will be many. ###### v11 I hereby guide you in the way of wisdom and I lead you in upright paths. ###### v12 When you walk, your steps will not be hampered, and when you run, you will not stumble. ###### v13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go; protect it, because it is your life. ###### v14 Do not enter the path of the wicked or walk in the way of those who are evil. ###### v15 Avoid it, do not go on it; turn away from it, and go on. ###### v16 For they cannot sleep unless they cause harm; they are robbed of sleep until they make someone stumble. ###### v17 Indeed they have eaten bread gained from wickedness and drink wine obtained from violence. ###### v18 But the path of the righteous is like the bright morning light, growing brighter and brighter until full day. ###### v19 The way of the wicked is like gloomy darkness; they do not know what they stumble over. ###### v20 My child, pay attention to my words; listen attentively to my sayings. ###### v21 Do not let them depart from your sight, guard them within your heart; ###### v22 for they are life to those who find them and healing to one's entire body. ###### v23 Guard your heart with all vigilance, for from it are the sources of life. ###### v24 Remove perverse speech from your mouth; keep devious talk far from your lips. ###### v25 Let your eyes look directly in front of you and let your gaze look straight before you. ###### v26 Make the path for your feet level, so that all your ways may be established. ###### v27 Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn yourself away from evil.
