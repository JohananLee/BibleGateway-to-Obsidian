Admonition to Avoid Seduction to Evil ###### 1 My child, be attentive to my wisdom, pay close attention to my understanding, ###### v2 in order to safeguard discretion, and that your lips may guard knowledge. ###### v3 For the lips of the adulterous woman drip honey, and her seductive words are smoother than olive oil, ###### v4 but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. ###### v5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave. ###### v6 Lest she should make level the path leading to life, her paths have wandered, but she is not able to discern it. ###### v7 So now, children, listen to me; do not turn aside from the words I speak. ###### v8 Keep yourself far from her, and do not go near the door of her house, ###### v9 lest you give your vigor to others and your years to a cruel person, ###### v10 lest strangers devour your strength, and your labor benefit another man's house. ###### v11 And at the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are wasted away. ###### v12 And you will say, "How I hated discipline! My heart spurned reproof! ###### v13 For I did not obey my teachers and I did not heed my instructors. ###### v14 I almost came to complete ruin in the midst of the whole congregation!" ###### v15 Drink water from your own cistern and running water from your own well. ###### v16 Should your springs be dispersed outside, your streams of water in the wide plazas? ###### v17 Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you. ###### v18 May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife you married in your youth-- ###### v19 a loving doe, a graceful deer; may her breasts satisfy you at all times, may you be captivated by her love always. ###### v20 But why should you be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, and embrace the bosom of a different woman? ###### v21 For the ways of a person are in front of the LORD's eyes, and the LORD weighs all that person's paths. ###### v22 The wicked will be captured by his own iniquities, and he will be held by the cords of his own sin. ###### v23 He will die because there was no discipline; because of the greatness of his folly he will reel.
