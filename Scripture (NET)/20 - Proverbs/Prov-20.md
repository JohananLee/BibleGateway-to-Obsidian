###### 1 Wine is a mocker and strong drink is a brawler; whoever goes astray by them is not wise. ###### v2 The king's terrifying anger is like the roar of a lion; whoever provokes him sins against himself. ###### v3 It is an honor for a person to cease from strife, but every fool quarrels. ###### v4 The sluggard will not plow during the planting season, so at harvest time he asks for grain but has nothing. ###### v5 Counsel in a person's heart is like deep water, but an understanding person draws it out. ###### v6 Many people profess their loyalty, but a faithful person--who can find? ###### v7 The righteous person behaves in integrity; blessed are his children after him. ###### v8 A king sitting on the throne to judge separates out all evil with his eyes. ###### v9 Who can say, "I have kept my heart clean; I am pure from my sin"? ###### v10 Diverse weights and diverse measures-- the LORD abhors both of them. ###### v11 Even a young man is known by his actions, whether his activity is pure and whether it is right. ###### v12 The ear that hears and the eye that sees-- the LORD has made them both. ###### v13 Do not love sleep, lest you become impoverished; open your eyes so that you might be satisfied with food. ###### v14 "It's worthless! It's worthless!" says the buyer, but when he goes on his way, he boasts. ###### v15 There is gold, and an abundance of rubies, but words of knowledge are like a precious jewel. ###### v16 Take a man's garment when he has given security for a stranger, and hold him in pledge on behalf of strangers. ###### v17 Bread gained by deceit tastes sweet to a person, but afterward his mouth will be filled with gravel. ###### v18 Plans are established by counsel, so make war with guidance. ###### v19 The one who goes about gossiping reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with someone who is always opening his mouth. ###### v20 The one who curses his father and his mother, his lamp will be extinguished in the blackest darkness. ###### v21 An inheritance gained easily in the beginning will not be blessed in the end. ###### v22 Do not say, "I will pay back evil!" Wait for the LORD, so that he may vindicate you. ###### v23 The LORD abhors differing weights, and dishonest scales are wicked. ###### v24 The steps of a person are ordained by the LORD-- so how can anyone understand his own way? ###### v25 It is a snare for a person to rashly cry, "Holy!" and only afterward to consider what he has vowed. ###### v26 A wise king separates out the wicked; he turns the threshing wheel over them. ###### v27 The human spirit is like the lamp of the LORD, searching all his innermost parts. ###### v28 Loyal love and truth preserve a king, and his throne is upheld by loyal love. ###### v29 The glory of young men is their strength, and the splendor of old men is gray hair. ###### v30 Beatings and wounds cleanse away evil, and floggings cleanse the innermost being.
