###### 1 A wise son accepts his father's discipline, but a scoffer has never listened to rebuke. ###### v2 From the fruit of his speech a person eats good things, but the treacherous desire the fruit of violence. ###### v3 The one who guards his words guards his life; whoever is talkative will come to ruin. ###### v4 The appetite of the sluggard craves but gets nothing, but the desire of the diligent will be abundantly satisfied. ###### v5 The righteous person will reject anything false, but the wicked person will act in shameful disgrace. ###### v6 Righteousness guards the one who lives with integrity, but wickedness overthrows the sinner. ###### v7 There is one who pretends to be rich and yet has nothing; another pretends to be poor and yet possesses great wealth. ###### v8 The ransom of a person's life is his wealth, thus the poor person has never heard a threat. ###### v9 The light of the righteous shines brightly, but the lamp of the wicked goes out. ###### v10 With pride comes only contention, but wisdom is with the well-advised. ###### v11 Wealth gained quickly will dwindle away, but the one who gathers it little by little will become rich. ###### v12 Hope deferred makes the heart sick, but a longing fulfilled is like a tree of life. ###### v13 The one who despises instruction will pay the penalty, but whoever esteems direction will be rewarded. ###### v14 Instruction from the wise is like a life-giving fountain, to turn a person from deadly snares. ###### v15 Keen insight wins favor, but the conduct of the treacherous ends in destruction. ###### v16 Every shrewd person acts with knowledge, but a fool displays his folly. ###### v17 An unreliable messenger falls into trouble, but a faithful envoy brings healing. ###### v18 The one who neglects discipline ends up in poverty and shame, but the one who accepts reproof is honored. ###### v19 A desire fulfilled will be sweet to the soul, but fools abhor turning away from evil. ###### v20 The one who associates with the wise grows wise, but a companion of fools suffers harm. ###### v21 Calamity pursues sinners, but prosperity rewards the righteous. ###### v22 A good person leaves an inheritance for his grandchildren, but the wealth of a sinner is stored up for the righteous. ###### v23 Abundant food may come from the field of the poor, but it is swept away by injustice. ###### v24 The one who spares his rod hates his child, but the one who loves his child is diligent in disciplining him. ###### v25 The righteous has enough food to satisfy his appetite, but the belly of the wicked will be empty.
