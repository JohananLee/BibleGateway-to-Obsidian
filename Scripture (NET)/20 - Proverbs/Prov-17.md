###### 1 Better is a dry crust of bread where there is quietness than a house full of feasting with strife. ###### v2 A servant who acts wisely will rule over an heir who behaves shamefully, and will share the inheritance along with the relatives. ###### v3 The crucible is for refining silver and the furnace is for gold, likewise the LORD tests hearts. ###### v4 One who acts wickedly pays attention to evil counsel; a liar listens to a malicious tongue. ###### v5 The one who mocks the poor has insulted his Creator; whoever rejoices over disaster will not go unpunished. ###### v6 Grandchildren are like a crown to the elderly, and the glory of children is their parents. ###### v7 Excessive speech is not becoming for a fool; how much less are lies for a ruler! ###### v8 A bribe works like a charm for the one who offers it; in whatever he does he succeeds. ###### v9 The one who forgives an offense seeks love, but whoever repeats a matter separates close friends. ###### v10 A rebuke makes a greater impression on a discerning person than a hundred blows on a fool. ###### v11 An evil person seeks only rebellion, and so a cruel messenger will be sent against him. ###### v12 It is better for a person to meet a mother bear being robbed of her cubs, than to encounter a fool in his folly. ###### v13 As for the one who repays evil for good, evil will not leave his house. ###### v14 Starting a quarrel is like letting out water; abandon strife before it breaks out! ###### v15 The one who acquits the guilty and the one who condemns the innocent-- both of them are an abomination to the LORD. ###### v16 What's the point of a fool having money in hand to buy wisdom, when his head is empty? ###### v17 A friend loves at all times, and a relative is born to help in adversity. ###### v18 The one who lacks sense strikes hands in pledge, and puts up financial security for his neighbor. ###### v19 The one who loves a quarrel loves transgression; whoever builds his gate high seeks destruction. ###### v20 The one who has a perverse heart does not find good, and the one who is deceitful in speech falls into trouble. ###### v21 Whoever brings a fool into the world does so to his grief, and the father of a fool has no joy. ###### v22 A cheerful heart brings good healing, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones. ###### v23 A wicked person receives a bribe secretly to pervert the ways of justice. ###### v24 Wisdom is directly in front of the discerning person, but the eyes of a fool run to the ends of the earth. ###### v25 A foolish child is a grief to his father, and bitterness to the mother who bore him. ###### v26 It is terrible to punish a righteous person, and to flog honorable men is wrong. ###### v27 The truly wise person restrains his words, and the one who stays calm is discerning. ###### v28 Even a fool who remains silent is considered wise, and the one who holds his tongue is deemed discerning.
