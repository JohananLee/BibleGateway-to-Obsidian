###### 1 Do not boast about tomorrow; for you do not know what a day may bring forth. ###### v2 Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; someone else, and not your own lips. ###### v3 A stone is heavy and sand is weighty, but vexation by a fool is more burdensome than the two of them. ###### v4 Wrath is cruel and anger is overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? ###### v5 Better is open rebuke than hidden love. ###### v6 Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are excessive. ###### v7 The one whose appetite is satisfied loathes honey, but to the hungry mouth every bitter thing is sweet. ###### v8 Like a bird that wanders from its nest, so is a person who wanders from his home. ###### v9 Ointment and incense make the heart rejoice, likewise the sweetness of one's friend from sincere counsel. ###### v10 Do not forsake your friend and your father's friend, and do not enter your brother's house in the day of your disaster; a neighbor nearby is better than a brother far away. ###### v11 Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, so that I may answer anyone who taunts me. ###### v12 A shrewd person saw danger--he hid himself; the naive passed right on by--they had to pay for it. ###### v13 Take a man's garment when he has given security for a stranger, and hold him in pledge on behalf of a stranger. ###### v14 If someone blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted as a curse to him. ###### v15 A continual dripping on a rainy day-- a contentious wife makes herself like that. ###### v16 Whoever contains her has contained the wind or can grasp oil with his right hand. ###### v17 As iron sharpens iron, so a person sharpens his friend. ###### v18 The one who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and whoever takes care of his master will be honored. ###### v19 As in water the face is reflected as a face, so a person's heart reflects the person. ###### v20 As Death and Destruction are never satisfied, so the eyes of a person are never satisfied. ###### v21 As the crucible is for silver and the furnace is for gold, so a person must put his praise to the test. ###### v22 If you should pound the fool in the mortar among the grain with the pestle, his foolishness would not depart from him. ###### v23 Pay careful attention to the condition of your flocks, set your mind on your herds, ###### v24 for riches do not last forever, nor does a crown last from generation to generation. ###### v25 When the hay is removed and new grass appears, and the grass from the hills is gathered in, ###### v26 the lambs will be for your clothing, and the goats will be for the price of a field. ###### v27 And there will be enough goat's milk for your food, for the food of your household, and for the sustenance of your servant girls.
