Benefits of Seeking Wisdom ###### 1 My child, if you receive my words, and store up my commands inside yourself, ###### v2 by making your ear attentive to wisdom, and by turning your heart to understanding, ###### v3 indeed, if you call out for discernment-- shout loudly for understanding-- ###### v4 if you seek it like silver, and search for it like hidden treasure, ###### v5 then you will understand how to fear the LORD, and you will discover knowledge about God. ###### v6 For the LORD gives wisdom, and from his mouth comes knowledge and understanding. ###### v7 He stores up effective counsel for the upright, and is like a shield for those who live with integrity, ###### v8 to guard the paths of the righteous and to protect the way of his pious ones. ###### v9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity--every good way. ###### v10 For wisdom will enter your heart, and moral knowledge will be attractive to you. ###### v11 Discretion will protect you, understanding will guard you, ###### v12 to deliver you from the way of the wicked, from those speaking perversity, ###### v13 who leave the upright paths to walk on the dark ways, ###### v14 who delight in doing evil, they rejoice in perverse evil; ###### v15 whose paths are morally crooked, and who are devious in their ways; ###### v16 to deliver you from the adulterous woman, from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words; ###### v17 who leaves the husband from her younger days, and has ignored her marriage covenant made before God. ###### v18 For she has set her house by death, and her paths by the place of the departed spirits. ###### v19 None who go in to her will return, nor will they reach the paths of life. ###### v20 So you will walk in the way of good people, and will keep on the paths of the righteous. ###### v21 For the upright will reside in the land, and those with integrity will remain in it, ###### v22 but the wicked will be removed from the land, and the treacherous will be torn away from it.
