The Words of Lemuel ###### 1 The words of King Lemuel, an oracle that his mother taught him: ###### v2 O my son, O son of my womb, O son of my vows, ###### v3 do not give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which ruins kings. ###### v4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to crave strong drink, ###### v5 lest they drink and forget what is decreed, and remove from all the poor their legal rights. ###### v6 Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those who are bitterly distressed; ###### v7 let them drink and forget their poverty, and remember their misery no more. ###### v8 Open your mouth on behalf of those unable to speak, for the legal rights of all the dying. ###### v9 Open your mouth, judge in righteousness, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.The Wife of Noble Character ###### v10 Who can find a wife of noble character? For her value is far more than rubies. ###### v11 Her husband's heart has trusted her, and he does not lack the dividends. ###### v12 She has rewarded him with good and not harm all the days of her life. ###### v13 She sought out wool and flax, then worked happily with her hands. ###### v14 She was like the merchant ships; she would bring in her food from afar. ###### v15 Then she rose while it was still night, and provided food for her household and a portion to her female servants. ###### v16 She considered a field and bought it; from her own income she planted a vineyard. ###### v17 She clothed herself in might, and she strengthened her arms. ###### v18 She perceived that her merchandise was good. Her lamp would not go out in the night. ###### v19 She extended her hands to the spool, and her hands grasped the spindle. ###### v20 She opened her hand to the poor, and extended her hands to the needy. ###### v21 She would not fear for her household in winter, because all her household were clothed with scarlet, ###### v22 because she had made coverings for herself; and because her clothing was fine linen and purple. ###### v23 Her husband is well-known in the city gate when he sits with the elders of the land. ###### v24 She made linen garments then sold them, and traded belts to the merchants; ###### v25 her clothing was strong and splendid; and she laughed at the time to come. ###### v26 She has opened her mouth with wisdom, with loving instruction on her tongue. ###### v27 Watching over the ways of her household, she would not eat the bread of idleness. ###### v28 Her children have risen and called her blessed; her husband also has praised her: ###### v29 "Many daughters have done valiantly, but you have surpassed them all!" ###### v30 Charm is deceitful and beauty is fleeting. A woman who fears the LORD--she makes herself praiseworthy. ###### v31 Give her credit for what she has accomplished, and let her works praise her in the city gates.
