###### 1 Every wise woman has built her household, but a foolish woman tears it down with her own hands. ###### v2 The one who walks in his uprightness fears the LORD, but the one who is perverted in his ways despises him. ###### v3 In the speech of a fool is a rod for his back, but the words of the wise protect them. ###### v4 Where there are no oxen, the feeding trough is clean, but an abundant harvest is produced by strong oxen. ###### v5 A truthful witness does not lie, but a false witness breathes out lies. ###### v6 The scorner sought wisdom--there was none, but understanding was easy for a discerning person. ###### v7 Walk abreast with a foolish person, and you do not understand wise counsel. ###### v8 The wisdom of the shrewd person is to discern his way, but the folly of fools is deception. ###### v9 Fools mock at reparation, but among the upright there is favor. ###### v10 The heart knows its own bitterness, and with its joy no one else can share. ###### v11 The household of the wicked will be destroyed, but the tent of the upright will flourish. ###### v12 There is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way that leads to death. ###### v13 Even in laughter the heart may ache, and the end of joy may be grief. ###### v14 The backslider will be paid back from his own ways, but a good person will be rewarded for his. ###### v15 A naive person will believe anything, but the shrewd person discerns his steps. ###### v16 A wise person is cautious and turns from evil, but a fool throws off restraint and is overconfident. ###### v17 A person who has a quick temper will do foolish things, and a person with crafty schemes will be hated. ###### v18 The naive have inherited folly, but the shrewd will be crowned with knowledge. ###### v19 Bad people have bowed before good people, and wicked people have bowed at the gates of someone righteous. ###### v20 A poor person will be disliked even by his neighbors, but those who love the rich are many. ###### v21 The one who despises his neighbor sins, but whoever is kind to the needy is blessed. ###### v22 Do not those who devise evil go astray? But those who plan good exhibit faithful covenant love. ###### v23 In all hard work there is profit, but merely talking about it only brings poverty. ###### v24 The crown of the wise is their riches, but the folly of fools is folly. ###### v25 A truthful witness rescues lives, but one who testifies falsely betrays them. ###### v26 In the fear of the LORD one has strong confidence, and it will be a refuge for his children. ###### v27 The fear of the LORD is like a life-giving fountain, to turn people from deadly snares. ###### v28 A king's glory is the abundance of people, but the lack of subjects is the ruin of a ruler. ###### v29 Someone with great understanding is slow to anger, but the one who has a quick temper exalts folly. ###### v30 A tranquil spirit revives the body, but envy is rottenness to the bones. ###### v31 The one who oppresses the poor has insulted his Creator, but whoever honors him shows favor to the needy. ###### v32 An evil person will be thrown down through his wickedness, but a righteous person takes refuge in his integrity. ###### v33 Wisdom rests in the heart of the discerning; it is not known in the inner parts of fools. ###### v34 Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a disgrace to any people. ###### v35 The king shows favor to a wise servant, but his wrath falls on one who acts shamefully.
