Admonition to Avoid the Wiles of the Adulteress ###### 1 My child, devote yourself to my words and store up my commands inside yourself. ###### v2 Keep my commands so that you may live, and obey my instruction as your most prized possession. ###### v3 Bind them on your forearm; write them on the tablet of your heart. ###### v4 Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call understanding a close relative, ###### v5 so that they may keep you from the adulterous woman, from the loose woman who has flattered you with her words. ###### v6 For at the window of my house through my window lattice I looked out ###### v7 and I saw among the naive-- I discerned among the youths-- a young man who lacked sense. ###### v8 He was passing by the street near her corner, making his way along the road to her house ###### v9 in the twilight, the evening, in the dark of the night. ###### v10 Suddenly a woman came out to meet him! She was dressed like a prostitute and with secret intent. ###### v11 (She is loud and rebellious, she does not remain at home-- ###### v12 at one time outside, at another in the wide plazas, and by every corner she lies in wait.) ###### v13 So she grabbed him and kissed him, and with a bold expression she said to him, ###### v14 "I have meat from my peace offerings at home; today I have fulfilled my vows! ###### v15 That is why I came out to meet you, to look for you, and I found you! ###### v16 I have spread my bed with elegant coverings, with richly colored fabric from Egypt. ###### v17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. ###### v18 Come, let's drink deeply of lovemaking until morning, let's delight ourselves with love's pleasures. ###### v19 For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a journey of some distance. ###### v20 He has taken a bag of money with him; he will not return until the end of the month." ###### v21 She turned him aside with her persuasions; with her smooth talk she was enticing him along. ###### v22 Suddenly he was going after her like an ox that goes to the slaughter, like a stag prancing into a trapper's snare ###### v23 till an arrow pierces his liver-- like a bird hurrying into a trap, and he does not know that it will cost him his life. ###### v24 So now, sons, listen to me, and pay attention to the words I speak. ###### v25 Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways-- do not wander into her pathways; ###### v26 for she has brought down many fatally wounded, and all those she has slain are many. ###### v27 Her house is the way to the grave, going down to the chambers of death.
