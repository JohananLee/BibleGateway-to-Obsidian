###### 1 Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is perverse in his speech and is a fool. ###### v2 It is dangerous to have zeal without knowledge, and the one who acts hastily makes poor choices. ###### v3 A person's folly subverts his way, and his heart rages against the LORD. ###### v4 Wealth adds many friends, but a poor person is separated from his friend. ###### v5 A false witness will not go unpunished, and the one who spouts out lies will not escape punishment. ###### v6 Many people entreat the favor of a generous person, and everyone is the friend of the person who gives gifts. ###### v7 All the relatives of a poor person hate him; how much more do his friends avoid him-- one who chases words, which are nothing. ###### v8 The one who acquires understanding loves himself; the one who preserves understanding will prosper. ###### v9 A false witness will not go unpunished, and the one who spouts out lies will perish. ###### v10 Luxury is not appropriate for a fool; how much less for a servant to rule over princes! ###### v11 A person's wisdom has made him slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook an offense. ###### v12 A king's wrath is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass. ###### v13 A foolish child is the ruin of his father, and a contentious wife is like a constant dripping. ###### v14 A house and wealth are inherited from parents, but a prudent wife is from the LORD. ###### v15 Laziness brings on a deep sleep, and the idle person will go hungry. ###### v16 The one who obeys commandments guards his life; the one who despises his ways will die. ###### v17 The one who is gracious to the poor lends to the LORD, and the LORD will repay him for his good deed. ###### v18 Discipline your child, for there is hope, but do not set your heart on causing his death. ###### v19 A person with great anger bears the penalty, but if you deliver him from it once, you will have to do it again. ###### v20 Listen to advice and receive discipline, that you may become wise by the end of your life. ###### v21 There are many plans in a person's mind, but it is the counsel of the LORD that will stand. ###### v22 What is desirable for a person is to show loyal love, and a poor person is better than a liar. ###### v23 Fearing the LORD leads to life, and one who does so will live satisfied; he will not be afflicted by calamity. ###### v24 The sluggard has plunged his hand into the dish, and he will not even bring it back to his mouth! ###### v25 Flog a scorner, and as a result the simpleton will learn prudence; correct a discerning person, and as a result he will understand knowledge. ###### v26 The one who robs his father and chases away his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace. ###### v27 If you stop listening to instruction, my child, you will stray from the words of knowledge. ###### v28 A crooked witness scorns justice, and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity. ###### v29 Penalties have been prepared for scorners, and floggings for the backs of fools.
