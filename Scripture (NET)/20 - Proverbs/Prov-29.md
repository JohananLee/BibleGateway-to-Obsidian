###### 1 The one who stiffens his neck after numerous rebukes will suddenly be destroyed without remedy. ###### v2 When the righteous become numerous, the people rejoice; when the wicked rule, the people groan. ###### v3 The man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father, but whoever associates with prostitutes wastes his wealth. ###### v4 A king brings stability to a land by justice, but one who exacts tribute tears it down. ###### v5 The one who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his steps. ###### v6 In the transgression of an evil person there is a snare, but a righteous person can sing and rejoice. ###### v7 The righteous person cares for the legal rights of the poor; the wicked person does not understand such knowledge. ###### v8 Scornful people inflame a city, but those who are wise turn away wrath. ###### v9 When a wise person goes to court with a foolish person, there is no peace whether he is angry or laughs. ###### v10 Bloodthirsty people hate someone with integrity; as for the upright, they seek his life. ###### v11 A fool lets fly with all his temper, but a wise person keeps it back. ###### v12 If a ruler listens to lies, all his ministers will be wicked. ###### v13 The poor person and the oppressor have this in common: the LORD gives light to the eyes of them both. ###### v14 If a king judges the poor in truth, his throne will be established forever. ###### v15 A rod and reproof impart wisdom, but a child who is unrestrained brings shame to his mother. ###### v16 When the wicked increase, transgression increases, but the righteous will see their downfall. ###### v17 Discipline your child, and he will give you rest; he will bring you happiness. ###### v18 When there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but the one who keeps the law, blessed is he! ###### v19 A servant cannot be corrected by words, for although he understands, there is no answer. ###### v20 You have seen someone who is hasty in his words-- there is more hope for a fool than for him. ###### v21 If someone pampers his servant from youth, he will be a weakling in the end. ###### v22 An angry person stirs up dissension, and a wrathful person is abounding in transgression. ###### v23 A person's pride will bring him low, but one who has a lowly spirit will gain honor. ###### v24 Whoever shares with a thief is his own enemy; he hears the oath to testify, but does not talk. ###### v25 The fear of people becomes a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD will be set on high. ###### v26 Many people seek the face of a ruler, but it is from the LORD that one receives justice. ###### v27 An unjust person is an abomination to the righteous, and the one who lives an upright life is an abomination to the wicked.
