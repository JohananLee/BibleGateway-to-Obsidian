###### 1 One who has isolated himself seeks his own desires; he rejects all sound judgment. ###### v2 A fool takes no pleasure in understanding but only in disclosing what is on his mind. ###### v3 When a wicked person arrives, contempt shows up with him, and with shame comes a reproach. ###### v4 The words of a person's mouth are like deep waters, and the fountain of wisdom is like a flowing brook. ###### v5 It is terrible to show partiality to the wicked, by depriving a righteous man of justice. ###### v6 The lips of a fool enter into strife, and his mouth invites a flogging. ###### v7 The mouth of a fool is his ruin, and his lips are a snare for his life. ###### v8 The words of a gossip are like choice morsels; and they have gone down into the person's innermost being. ###### v9 The one who is slack in his work is a brother to one who destroys. ###### v10 The name of the LORD is like a strong tower; the righteous person runs to it and is set safely on high. ###### v11 The wealth of a rich person is like a strong city, and it is like a high wall in his imagination. ###### v12 Before destruction the heart of a person is proud, but humility comes before honor. ###### v13 The one who gives an answer before he listens-- that is his folly and his shame. ###### v14 A person's spirit sustains him through sickness-- but who can bear a crushed spirit? ###### v15 The discerning person acquires knowledge, and the wise person seeks knowledge. ###### v16 A person's gift makes room for him, and leads him before important people. ###### v17 The first to state his case seems right, until his opponent begins to cross-examine him. ###### v18 A toss of a coin ends disputes, and settles the issue between strong opponents. ###### v19 A relative offended is harder to reach than a strong city, and disputes are like the barred gates of a fortified citadel. ###### v20 From the fruit of a person's mouth his stomach will be satisfied, with the product of his lips he will be satisfied. ###### v21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love its use will eat its fruit. ###### v22 The one who has found a good wife has found what goodness is, and obtained a delightful gift from the LORD. ###### v23 A poor person makes supplications, but a rich man answers harshly. ###### v24 There are companions who harm one another, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
