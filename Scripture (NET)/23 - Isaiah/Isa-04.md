###### 1 Seven women will grab hold of one man at that time. They will say, "We will provide our own food, we will provide our own clothes; but let us belong to you-- take away our shame!"The Branch of the Lord ###### v2 At that time the crops given by the LORD will bring admiration and honor; the produce of the land will be a source of pride and delight to those who remain in Israel. ###### v3 Those remaining in Zion, those left in Jerusalem, will be called "holy," all in Jerusalem who are destined to live. ###### v4 At that time the Lord will wash the excrement from Zion's women, he will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem's midst, as he comes to judge and to bring devastation. ###### v5 Then the LORD will create over all Mount Zion and over its convocations a cloud and smoke by day and a bright flame of fire by night; indeed a canopy will accompany the LORD's glorious presence. ###### v6 By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat, as well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour.
