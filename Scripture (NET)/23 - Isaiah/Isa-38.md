The Lord Hears Hezekiah's Prayer ###### 1 In those days Hezekiah was stricken with a terminal illness. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz visited him and told him, "This is what the LORD says, 'Give instructions to your household, for you are about to die; you will not get well.'" ###### v2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD, ###### v3 "Please, LORD. Remember how I have served you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion, and how I have carried out your will." Then Hezekiah wept bitterly. ###### v4 The Lord's message came to Isaiah, ###### v5 "Go and tell Hezekiah: 'This is what the LORD God of your ancestor David says: "I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Look, I will add fifteen years to your life. ###### v6 I will also rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will shield this city."'" ###### v7 Isaiah replied, "This is your sign from the LORD confirming that the LORD will do what he has said: ###### v8 Look, I will make the shadow go back ten steps on the stairs of Ahaz." And then the shadow went back ten steps.Hezekiah's Song of Thanks ###### v9 This is the prayer of King Hezekiah of Judah when he was sick and then recovered from his illness: ###### v10 "I thought, 'In the middle of my life I must walk through the gates of Sheol, I am deprived of the rest of my years.' ###### v11 "I thought, 'I will no longer see the LORD in the land of the living, I will no longer look on humankind with the inhabitants of the world. ###### v12 My dwelling place is removed and taken away from me as a shepherd's tent. I rolled up my life like a weaver rolls cloth; from the loom he cuts me off. You turn day into night and end my life. ###### v13 I cry out until morning; like a lion he shatters all my bones; you turn day into night and end my life. ###### v14 Like a swallow or a thrush I chirp, I coo like a dove; my eyes grow tired from looking up to the sky. O Lord, I am oppressed; help me! ###### v15 What can I say? He has decreed and acted. I will walk slowly all my years because I am overcome with grief. ###### v16 O Lord, your decrees can give men life; may years of life be restored to me. Restore my health and preserve my life.' ###### v17 "Look, the grief I experienced was for my benefit. You delivered me from the Pit of oblivion. For you removed all my sins from your sight. ###### v18 Indeed Sheol does not give you thanks; death does not praise you. Those who descend into the Pit do not anticipate your faithfulness. ###### v19 The living person, the living person, he gives you thanks, as I do today. A father tells his sons about your faithfulness. ###### v20 The LORD is about to deliver me, and we will celebrate with music for the rest of our lives in the LORD's temple." ###### v21 (Isaiah ordered, "Let them take a fig cake and apply it to the ulcerated sore and he will get well." <sup class="versenum mid-line">22</sup>Hezekiah said, "What is the confirming sign that I will go up to the LORD's temple?")
