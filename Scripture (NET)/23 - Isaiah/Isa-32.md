Justice and Wisdom Will Prevail ###### 1 Look, a king will promote fairness; officials will promote justice. ###### v2 Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from a rainstorm; like streams of water in a dry region and like the shade of a large cliff in a parched land. ###### v3 Eyes will no longer be blind and ears will be attentive. ###### v4 The mind that acts rashly will possess discernment, and the tongue that stutters will speak with ease and clarity. ###### v5 A fool will no longer be called honorable; a deceiver will no longer be called principled. ###### v6 For a fool speaks disgraceful things; his mind plans out sinful deeds. He commits godless deeds and says misleading things about the LORD; he gives the hungry nothing to satisfy their appetite and gives the thirsty nothing to drink. ###### v7 A deceiver's methods are evil; he dreams up evil plans to ruin the poor with lies, even when the needy are in the right. ###### v8 An honorable man makes honorable plans; his honorable character gives him security.The Lord Will Give True Security ###### v9 You complacent women, get up and listen to me! You carefree daughters, pay attention to what I say! ###### v10 In a year's time you carefree ones will shake with fear, for the grape harvest will fail, and the fruit harvest will not arrive. ###### v11 Tremble, you complacent ones! Shake with fear, you carefree ones! Strip off your clothes and expose yourselves-- put sackcloth around your waists. ###### v12 Mourn over the field, over the delightful fields and the fruitful vine. ###### v13 Mourn over the land of my people, which is overgrown with thorns and briers, and over all the once-happy houses in the city filled with revelry. ###### v14 For the fortress is neglected; the once-crowded city is abandoned. Hill and watchtower are permanently uninhabited. Wild donkeys love to go there, and flocks graze there. ###### v15 This desolation will continue until new life is poured out on us from heaven. Then the wilderness will become an orchard and the orchard will be considered a forest. ###### v16 Justice will settle down in the wilderness and fairness will live in the orchard. ###### v17 Fairness will produce peace and result in lasting security. ###### v18 My people will live in peaceful settlements, in secure homes, and in safe, quiet places. ###### v19 Even if the forest is destroyed and the city is annihilated, ###### v20 you will be blessed, you who plant seed by all the banks of the streams, you who let your ox and donkey graze.
