###### 1 At that time you will say: "I praise you, O LORD, for even though you were angry with me, your anger subsided, and you consoled me. ###### v2 Look, God is my deliverer! I will trust in him and not fear. For the LORD gives me strength and protects me; he has become my deliverer." ###### v3 Joyfully you will draw water from the springs of deliverance. ###### v4 At that time you will say: "Praise the LORD! Ask him for help! Publicize his mighty acts among the nations. Make it known that he is unique. ###### v5 Sing to the LORD, for he has done magnificent things; let this be known throughout the earth. ###### v6 Cry out and shout for joy, O citizens of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel acts mightily among you!"
