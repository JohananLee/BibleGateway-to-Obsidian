The Lord Will Judge Babylon ###### 1 This is an oracle about the wilderness by the Sea: Like strong winds blowing in the south, one invades from the wilderness, from a land that is feared. ###### v2 I have received a distressing message: "The deceiver deceives, the destroyer destroys. Attack, you Elamites! Lay siege, you Medes! I will put an end to all the groaning." ###### v3 For this reason my stomach churns; cramps overwhelm me like the contractions of a woman in labor. I am disturbed by what I hear, horrified by what I see. ###### v4 My heart palpitates, I shake in fear; the twilight I desired has brought me terror. ###### v5 Arrange the table, lay out the carpet, eat and drink! Get up, you officers, smear oil on the shields! ###### v6 For this is what the Lord has told me: "Go, post a guard! He must report what he sees. ###### v7 When he sees chariots, teams of horses, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, he must be alert, very alert." ###### v8 Then the guard cries out: "On the watchtower, O Lord, I stand all day long; at my post I am stationed every night. ###### v9 Look what's coming! A charioteer, a team of horses." When questioned, he replies, "Babylon has fallen, fallen! All the idols of her gods lie shattered on the ground!" ###### v10 O my downtrodden people, crushed like stalks on the threshing floor, what I have heard from the LORD of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, I have reported to you.Bad News for Seir ###### v11 This is an oracle about Dumah: Someone calls to me from Seir, "Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?" ###### v12 The watchman replies, "Morning is coming, but then night. If you want to ask, ask; come back again."The Lord Will Judge Arabia ###### v13 This is an oracle about Arabia: In the thicket of Arabia you spend the night, you Dedanite caravans. ###### v14 Bring out some water for the thirsty. You who live in the land of Tema, bring some food for the fugitives. ###### v15 For they flee from the swords-- from the drawn sword, and from the battle-ready bow, and from the severity of the battle. ###### v16 For this is what the Lord has told me: "Within exactly one year all the splendor of Kedar will come to an end. ###### v17 Just a handful of archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be left." Indeed, the LORD God of Israel has spoken.
