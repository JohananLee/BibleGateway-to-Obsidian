The Prophet Speaks ###### 1 I am the man who has experienced affliction from the rod of theLORD's wrath. ###### v2 He drove me into captivity and made me walk in darkness and not light. ###### v3 He repeatedly attacks me; he turns his hand against me all day long. ###### v4 He has made my mortal skin waste away; he has broken my bones. ###### v5 He has besieged and surrounded me with bitter hardship. ###### v6 He has made me reside in deepest darkness like those who died long ago. ###### v7 He has walled me in so that I cannot get out; he has weighted me down with heavy prison chains. ###### v8 Also, when I cry out desperately for help, he has shut out my prayer. ###### v9 He has blocked every road I take with a wall of hewn stones; he has made every path impassable. ###### v10 To me he is like a bear lying in ambush, like a hidden lion stalking its prey. ###### v11 He has obstructed my paths and torn me to pieces; he has made me desolate. ###### v12 He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrow. ###### v13 He shot his arrows into my heart. ###### v14 I have become the laughingstock of all people, their mocking song all day long. ###### v15 He has given me my fill of bitter herbs and made me drunk with bitterness. ###### v16 He ground my teeth in gravel; he trampled me in the dust. ###### v17 I am deprived of peace; I have forgotten what happiness is. ###### v18 So I said, "My endurance has expired; I have lost all hope of deliverance from the LORD." ###### v19 Remember my impoverished and homeless condition, which is a bitter poison. ###### v20 I continually think about this, and I am depressed. ###### v21 But this I call to mind; therefore I have hope: ###### v22 The LORD's loyal kindness never ceases; his compassions never end. ###### v23 They are fresh every morning; your faithfulness is abundant! ###### v24 "My portion is the LORD," I have said to myself, so I will put my hope in him. ###### v25 The LORD is good to those who trust in him, to the one who seeks him. ###### v26 It is good to wait patiently for deliverance from the LORD. ###### v27 It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young. ###### v28 Let a person sit alone in silence, when the LORD is disciplining him. ###### v29 Let him bury his face in the dust; perhaps there is hope. ###### v30 Let him offer his cheek to the one who hits him; let him have his fill of insults. ###### v31 For the Lord will not reject us forever. ###### v32 Though he causes us grief, he then has compassion on us according to the abundance of his loyal kindness. ###### v33 For he is not predisposed to afflict or to grieve people. ###### v34 To crush underfoot all the earth's prisoners, ###### v35 to deprive a person of his rights in the presence of the Most High, ###### v36 to defraud a person in a lawsuit-- the Lord does not approve of such things! ###### v37 Whose command was ever fulfilled unless the Lord decreed it? ###### v38 Is it not from the mouth of the Most High that everything comes-- both calamity and blessing? ###### v39 Why should any living person complain when punished for his sins? ###### v40 Let us carefully examine our ways, and let us return to the LORD. ###### v41 Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven: ###### v42 "We have blatantly rebelled; you have not forgiven." ###### v43 You shrouded yourself with anger and then pursued us; you killed without mercy. ###### v44 You shrouded yourself with a cloud so that no prayer could get through. ###### v45 You make us like filthy scum in the estimation of the nations. ###### v46 All our enemies have gloated over us; ###### v47 panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction. ###### v48 Streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed. ###### v49 Tears flow from my eyes and will not stop; there will be no break ###### v50 until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees what has happened. ###### v51 What my eyes see grieves me-- all the suffering of the daughters in my city. ###### v52 For no good reason my enemies hunted me down like a bird. ###### v53 They shut me up in a pit and threw stones at me. ###### v54 The waters closed over my head; I thought I was about to die. ###### v55 I have called on your name, O LORD, from the deepest pit. ###### v56 You heard my plea: "Do not close your ears to my cry for relief!" ###### v57 You came near on the day I called to you; you said, "Do not fear!" ###### v58 O Lord, you championed my cause; you redeemed my life. ###### v59 You have seen the wrong done to me, O LORD; pronounce judgment on my behalf! ###### v60 You have seen all their vengeance, all their plots against me. ###### v61 You have heard their taunts, O LORD, all their plots against me. ###### v62 My assailants revile and conspire against me all day long. ###### v63 Watch them from morning to evening; I am the object of their mocking songs. ###### v64 Pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, according to what they have done. ###### v65 Give them a distraught heart; may your curse be on them! ###### v66 Pursue them in anger and eradicate them from under the LORD's heaven.
