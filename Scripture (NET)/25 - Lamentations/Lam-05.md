The People of Jerusalem Pray ###### 1 O LORD, reflect on what has happened to us; consider and look at our disgrace. ###### v2 Our inheritance is turned over to strangers; foreigners now occupy our homes. ###### v3 We have become fatherless orphans; our mothers have become widows. ###### v4 We must pay money for our own water; we must buy our own wood at a steep price. ###### v5 We are pursued--they are breathing down our necks; we are weary and have no rest. ###### v6 We have submitted to Egypt and Assyria in order to buy food to eat. ###### v7 Our forefathers sinned and are dead, but we suffer their punishment. ###### v8 Slaves rule over us; there is no one to rescue us from their power. ###### v9 At the risk of our lives we get our food because robbers lurk in the wilderness. ###### v10 Our skin is as hot as an oven due to a fever from hunger. ###### v11 They raped women in Zion, virgins in the towns of Judah. ###### v12 Princes were hung by their hands; elders were mistreated. ###### v13 The young men perform menial labor; boys stagger from their labor. ###### v14 The elders are gone from the city gate; the young men have stopped playing their music. ###### v15 Our hearts no longer have any joy; our dancing is turned to mourning. ###### v16 The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! ###### v17 Because of this, our hearts are sick; because of these things, we can hardly see through our tears. ###### v18 For wild animals are prowling over Mount Zion, which lies desolate. ###### v19 But you, O LORD, reign forever; your throne endures from generation to generation. ###### v20 Why do you keep on forgetting us? Why do you forsake us so long? ###### v21 Bring us back to yourself, O LORD, so that we may return to you; renew our life as in days before, ###### v22 unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure.
