Leading and Living in God's Flock ###### 1 So as your fellow elder and a witness of Christ's sufferings and as one who shares in the glory that will be revealed, I urge the elders among you: ###### v2 Give a shepherd's care to God's flock among you, exercising oversight not merely as a duty but willingly under God's direction, not for shameful profit but eagerly. ###### v3 And do not lord it over those entrusted to you, but be examples to the flock. ###### v4 Then when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that never fades away. ###### v5 In the same way, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because God **_opposes_** **_the proud but gives grace to the humble_**. ###### v6 And God will exalt you in due time, if you humble yourselves under his mighty hand ###### v7 by casting all your cares on him because he cares for you. ###### v8 Be sober and alert. Your enemy the devil, _like_ _a roaring lion,_ is on the prowl looking for someone to devour. ###### v9 Resist him, strong in your faith, because you know that your brothers and sisters throughout the world are enduring the same kinds of suffering. ###### v10 And, after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in Christ will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. ###### v11 To him belongs the power forever. Amen.Final Greetings ###### v12 Through Silvanus, whom I know to be a faithful brother, I have written to you briefly, in order to encourage you and testify that this is the true grace of God. Stand fast in it. ###### v13 The church in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you, and so does Mark, my son. ###### v14 Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
