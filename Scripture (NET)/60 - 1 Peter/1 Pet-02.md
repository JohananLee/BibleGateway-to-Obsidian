###### 1 So get rid of all evil and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander. ###### v2 And yearn like newborn infants for pure, spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up to salvation, ###### v3 if **_you have experienced_** **_the Lord's kindness_**.A Living Stone, a Chosen People ###### v4 So as you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but chosen and precious in God's sight, ###### v5 you yourselves, as living stones, are built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood and to offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. ###### v6 For it says in scripture, "_**Look, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen and precious cornerstone**,_ **_and_** **_whoever believes_** **_in_** **_him_** **_will_** **_never_** **_be put to shame_**." ###### v7 So you who believe see his value, but for those who do not believe, **_the stone that the builders rejected has become the_** _**cornerstone**,_ ###### v8 and **_a stumbling-stone_** **_and a rock to trip over_**. They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. ###### v9 But you are _a chosen race_, _a royal priesthood_, _a holy nation_, _a people of his own_, so that you may _proclaim_ _the virtues_ of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. ###### v10 You once were **_not_** **_a people_**, but now you are God's people. You were **_shown_** **_no mercy,_** but now you have received mercy. ###### v11 Dear friends, I urge you as foreigners and exiles to keep away from fleshly desires that do battle against the soul, ###### v12 and maintain good conduct among the non-Christians, so that though they now malign you as wrongdoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God when he appears.Submission to Authorities ###### v13 Be subject to every human institution for the Lord's sake, whether to a king as supreme ###### v14 or to governors as those he commissions to punish wrongdoers and praise those who do good. ###### v15 For God wants you to silence the ignorance of foolish people by doing good. ###### v16 Live as free people, not using your freedom as a pretext for evil, but as God's slaves. ###### v17 Honor all people, love the family of believers, fear God, honor the king. ###### v18 Slaves, be subject to your masters with all reverence, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are perverse. ###### v19 For this finds God's favor, if because of conscience toward God someone endures hardships in suffering unjustly. ###### v20 For what credit is it if you sin and are mistreated and endure it? But if you do good and suffer and so endure, this finds favor with God. ###### v21 For to this you were called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps. ###### v22 He **_committed_** **_no_** sin **_nor_** **_was deceit found in his mouth_**. ###### v23 When he was maligned, he did not answer back; when he suffered, he threatened no retaliation, but committed himself to God who judges justly. ###### v24 He **_himself_** **_bore our sins_** in his body on the tree, that we may cease from sinning and live for righteousness. **_By_** his **_wounds_** **_you were healed_**. ###### v25 For you were **_going astray like sheep_** but now you have turned back to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.
