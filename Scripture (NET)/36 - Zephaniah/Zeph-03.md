Jerusalem is Corrupt ###### 1 Beware to the filthy, stained city; the city filled with oppressors! ###### v2 She is disobedient; she has refused correction. She does not trust the LORD; she has not sought the advice of her God. ###### v3 Her princes are as fierce as roaring lions; her rulers are as hungry as wolves in the desert, who completely devour their prey by morning. ###### v4 Her prophets are proud; they are deceitful men. Her priests have defiled what is holy; they have broken God's laws. ###### v5 The just LORD resides within her; he commits no unjust acts. Every morning he reveals his justice. At dawn he appears without fail. Yet the unjust know no shame.The Lord's Judgment will Purify ###### v6 "I destroyed nations; their walled cities are in ruins. I turned their streets into ruins; no one passes through them. Their cities are desolate; no one lives there. ###### v7 I thought, 'Certainly you will respect me! Now you will accept correction!' If she had done so, her home would not be destroyed by all the punishments I have threatened. But they eagerly sinned in everything they did. ###### v8 Therefore you must wait patiently for me," says the LORD, "for the day when I attack and take plunder. I have decided to gather nations together and assemble kingdoms, so I can pour out my fury on them-- all my raging anger. For the whole earth will be consumed by my fiery anger. ###### v9 Know for sure that I will then enable the nations to give me acceptable praise. All of them will invoke the LORD's name when they pray, and will worship him in unison. ###### v10 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, those who pray to me, my dispersed people, will bring me tribute. ###### v11 In that day you will not be ashamed of all your rebelliousness against me, for then I will remove from your midst those who proudly boast, and you will never again be arrogant on my holy hill. ###### v12 I will leave in your midst a humble and meek group of people, and they will find safety in the LORD's presence. ###### v13 The Israelites who remain will not act deceitfully. They will not lie, and a deceitful tongue will not be found in their mouths. Indeed, they will graze peacefully like sheep and lie down; no one will terrify them." ###### v14 Shout for joy, Daughter Zion! Shout out, Israel! Be happy and boast with all your heart, Daughter Jerusalem! ###### v15 The LORD has removed the judgment against you; he has turned back your enemy. Israel's king, the LORD, is in your midst! You no longer need to fear disaster. ###### v16 On that day they will say to Jerusalem, "Don't be afraid, Zion! Your hands must not be paralyzed from panic! ###### v17 The LORD your God is in your midst; he is a warrior who can deliver. He takes great delight in you; he renews you by his love; he shouts for joy over you." ###### v18 "As for those who grieve because they cannot attend the festivals-- I took them away from you; they became tribute and were a source of shame to you. ###### v19 Look, at that time I will deal with those who mistreated you. I will rescue the lame sheep and gather together the scattered sheep. I will take away their humiliation and make the whole earth admire and respect them. ###### v20 At that time I will lead you-- at the time I gather you together. Be sure of this! I will make all the nations of the earth respect and admire you when you see me restore you," says the LORD.
