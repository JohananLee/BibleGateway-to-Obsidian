Consecration of the Believer's Life ###### 1 Therefore I exhort you, brothers and sisters, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a sacrifice--alive, holy, and pleasing to God--which is your reasonable service. ###### v2 Do not be conformed to this present world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may test and approve what is the will of God--what is good and well-pleasing and perfect.Conduct in Humility ###### v3 For by the grace given to me I say to every one of you not to think more highly of yourself than you ought to think, but to think with sober discernment, as God has distributed to each of you a measure of faith. ###### v4 For just as in one body we have many members, and not all the members serve the same function, ###### v5 so we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually we are members who belong to one another. ###### v6 And we have different gifts according to the grace given to us. If the gift is prophecy, that individual must use it in proportion to his faith. ###### v7 If it is service, he must serve; if it is teaching, he must teach; ###### v8 if it is exhortation, he must exhort; if it is contributing, he must do so with sincerity; if it is leadership, he must do so with diligence; if it is showing mercy, he must do so with cheerfulness.Conduct in Love ###### v9 Love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil, cling to what is good. ###### v10 Be devoted to one another with mutual love, showing eagerness in honoring one another. ###### v11 Do not lag in zeal, be enthusiastic in spirit, serve the Lord. ###### v12 Rejoice in hope, endure in suffering, persist in prayer. ###### v13 Contribute to the needs of the saints, pursue hospitality. ###### v14 Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse. ###### v15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. ###### v16 Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited. ###### v17 Do not repay anyone evil for evil; consider what is good before all people. ###### v18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all people. ###### v19 Do not avenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to God's wrath, for it is written, "**_Vengeance is mine, I will repay_**," says the Lord. ###### v20 Rather, **_if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head_**. ###### v21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
