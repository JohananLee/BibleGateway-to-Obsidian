Israel's Rejection Considered ###### 1 I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me in the Holy Spirit-- ###### v2 I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. ###### v3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed--cut off from Christ--for the sake of my people, my fellow countrymen, ###### v4 who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises. ###### v5 To them belong the patriarchs, and from them, by human descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, blessed forever! Amen. ###### v6 It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel, ###### v7 nor are all the children Abraham's true descendants; rather "**_through Isaac will your descendants be counted_**." ###### v8 This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; rather, the children of promise are counted as descendants. ###### v9 For this is what the promise declared: "**_About a year from now_** **_I will return and Sarah will have a son_**." ###### v10 Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our ancestor Isaac-- ###### v11 even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's purpose in election would stand, not by works but by his calling)-- ###### v12 it was said to her, "**_The older will serve the younger_**," ###### v13 just as it is written: "**_Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated_**." ###### v14 What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! ###### v15 For he says to Moses: "**_I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion_**." ###### v16 So then, it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on God who shows mercy. ###### v17 For the scripture says to Pharaoh: "**_For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may demonstrate my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth_**." ###### v18 So then, God has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy, and he hardens whom he chooses to harden. ###### v19 You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who has ever resisted his will?" ###### v20 But who indeed are you--a mere human being--to talk back to God? **_Does what is molded say to the molder_**, "**_Why have you made me like this?_**" ###### v21 Has the potter no right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special use and another for ordinary use? ###### v22 But what if God, willing to demonstrate his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience the objects of wrath prepared for destruction? ###### v23 And what if he is willing to make known the wealth of his glory on the objects of mercy that he has prepared beforehand for glory-- ###### v24 even us, whom he has called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? ###### v25 As he also says in Hosea: "**_I will call those who were not my people_**, '**_My people_**,' **_and I will call her who was unloved,_** '**_My beloved_**.'" ###### v26 "**_And in the very place_** **_where it was said to them_**, '**_You are not my people_**,' **_there they will be called_** '**_sons of the living God_**.'" ###### v27 And Isaiah cries out on behalf of Israel, "_Though the number of the children_ _of Israel are as the sand of the sea_, _only the remnant will be saved_, ###### v28 _for_ _the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and quickly_." ###### v29 Just as Isaiah predicted, "If the Lord of Heaven's Armies had not left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, and we would have resembled Gomorrah."Israel's Rejection Culpable ###### v30 What shall we say then?--that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith, ###### v31 but Israel even though pursuing a law of righteousness did not attain it. ###### v32 Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but (as if it were possible) by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, ###### v33 just as it is written, "**_Look, I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble_** **_and a rock that will make them fall,_** **_yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame_.**"
