###### 1 Brothers and sisters, my heart's desire and prayer to God on behalf of my fellow Israelites is for their salvation. ###### v2 For I can testify that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not in line with the truth. ###### v3 For ignoring the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to God's righteousness. ###### v4 For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes. ###### v5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: "**_The one who does these things will live by them_**." ###### v6 But the righteousness that is by faith says: "**_Do not say in your heart_**, '_**Who will ascend into heaven**?_'" (that is, to bring Christ down) ###### v7 or "**_Who will descend into the abyss?_**" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). ###### v8 But what does it say? "**_The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart_**" (that is, the word of faith that we preach), ###### v9 because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. ###### v10 For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness and with the mouth one confesses and thus has salvation. ###### v11 For the scripture says, "**_Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame_**." ###### v12 For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who richly blesses all who call on him. ###### v13 For **_everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved_**. ###### v14 How are they to call on one they have not believed in? And how are they to believe in one they have not heard of? And how are they to hear without someone preaching to them? ###### v15 And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "**_How timely_** **_is the arrival_** **_of those who proclaim the good news_**." ###### v16 But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, "**_Lord, who has believed our report_**?" ###### v17 Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the preached word of Christ. ###### v18 But I ask, have they not heard? Yes, they have: **_Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world_**. ###### v19 But again I ask, didn't Israel understand? First Moses says, "**_I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; with a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger_**." ###### v20 And Isaiah is even bold enough to say, "**_I was found by those who did not seek me; I became well known to those who did not ask for me_**." ###### v21 But about Israel he says, "**_All day long I held out my hands to this disobedient and stubborn people!_**"
