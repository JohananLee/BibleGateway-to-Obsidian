Israel's Rejection not Complete nor Final ###### 1 So I ask, God has not rejected his people, has he? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. ###### v2 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? ###### v3 "Lord, **_they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left and they are seeking my life!_**" ###### v4 But what was the divine response to him? "**_I have kept_** for myself **_7,000 people_** **_who have not bent the knee to Baal_**." ###### v5 So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. ###### v6 And if it is by grace, it is no longer by works, otherwise grace would no longer be grace. ###### v7 What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was diligently seeking, but the elect obtained it. The rest were hardened, ###### v8 as it is written, "_**God gave them a spirit of stupor**,_ **_eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear_**, **_to this very day_.**" ###### v9 And David says, "_**Let their table become a snare and trap**,_ _**a stumbling block and a retribution for them**;_ ###### v10 **_let their eyes be darkened so that they may not see,_** **_and make their backs bend continually_.**" ###### v11 I ask then, they did not stumble into an irrevocable fall, did they? Absolutely not! But by their transgression salvation has come to the Gentiles, to make Israel jealous. ###### v12 Now if their transgression means riches for the world and their defeat means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full restoration bring? ###### v13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Seeing that I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry, ###### v14 if somehow I could provoke my people to jealousy and save some of them. ###### v15 For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead? ###### v16 If the first portion of the dough offered is holy, then the whole batch is holy, and if the root is holy, so too are the branches. ###### v17 Now if some of the branches were broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among them and participated in the richness of the olive root, ###### v18 do not boast over the branches. But if you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you. ###### v19 Then you will say, "The branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." ###### v20 Granted! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear! ###### v21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps he will not spare you. ###### v22 Notice therefore the kindness and harshness of God--harshness toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness toward you, provided you continue in his kindness; otherwise you also will be cut off. ###### v23 And even they--if they do not continue in their unbelief--will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. ###### v24 For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree? ###### v25 For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: A partial hardening has happened to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. ###### v26 And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: "**_The Deliverer will come out of Zion;_** **_he will remove ungodliness from Jacob_**. ###### v27 _**And this is my covenant with them**,_ **_when I take away their sins_.**" ###### v28 In regard to the gospel they are enemies for your sake, but in regard to election they are dearly loved for the sake of the fathers. ###### v29 For the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable. ###### v30 Just as you were formerly disobedient to God, but have now received mercy due to their disobedience, ###### v31 so they too have now been disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now receive mercy. ###### v32 For God has consigned all people to disobedience so that he may show mercy to them all. ###### v33 Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how unfathomable his ways! ###### v34 _**For who has known the mind of the Lord**,_ **_or who has been his counselor?_** ###### v35 _**Or who has first given to God**,_ **_that God_** **_needs to repay him?_** ###### v36 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever! Amen.
