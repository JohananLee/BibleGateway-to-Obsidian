Charge to Timothy Repeated ###### 1 I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom: ###### v2 Preach the message, be ready whether it is convenient or not, reprove, rebuke, exhort with complete patience and instruction. ###### v3 For there will be a time when people will not tolerate sound teaching. Instead, following their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves, because they have an insatiable curiosity to hear new things. ###### v4 And they will turn away from hearing the truth, but on the other hand they will turn aside to myths. ###### v5 You, however, be self-controlled in all things, endure hardship, do an evangelist's work, fulfill your ministry. ###### v6 For I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time for me to depart is at hand. ###### v7 I have competed well; I have finished the race; I have kept the faith! ###### v8 Finally the crown of righteousness is reserved for me. The Lord, the righteous Judge, will award it to me in that day--and not to me only, but also to all who have set their affection on his appearing.Travel Plans and Concluding Greetings ###### v9 Make every effort to come to me soon. ###### v10 For Demas deserted me, since he loved the present age, and he went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia and Titus to Dalmatia. ###### v11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is a great help to me in ministry. ###### v12 Now I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. ###### v13 When you come, bring with you the cloak I left in Troas with Carpas and the scrolls, especially the parchments. ###### v14 Alexander the coppersmith did me a great deal of harm. _The Lord will repay him in keeping with his deeds_. ###### v15 You be on guard against him too, because he vehemently opposed our words. ###### v16 At my first defense no one appeared in my support; instead they all deserted me--may they not be held accountable for it. ###### v17 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message would be fully proclaimed for all the Gentiles to hear. And so I was delivered from the lion's mouth! ###### v18 The Lord will deliver me from every evil deed and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be glory for ever and ever! Amen. ###### v19 Greetings to Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus. ###### v20 Erastus stayed in Corinth. Trophimus I left ill in Miletus. ###### v21 Make every effort to come before winter. Greetings to you from Eubulus, Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters. ###### v22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
