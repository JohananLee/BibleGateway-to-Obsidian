Ministry in the Last Days ###### 1 But understand this, that in the last days difficult times will come. ###### v2 For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, ###### v3 unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, opposed to what is good, ###### v4 treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God. ###### v5 They will maintain the outward appearance of religion but will have repudiated its power. So avoid people like these. ###### v6 For some of these insinuate themselves into households and captivate weak women who are overwhelmed with sins and led along by various passions. ###### v7 Such women are always seeking instruction, yet never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth. ###### v8 And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people--who have warped minds and are disqualified in the faith--also oppose the truth. ###### v9 But they will not go much further, for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just like it was with Jannes and Jambres.Continue in What You Have Learned ###### v10 You, however, have followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, ###### v11 as well as the persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra. I endured these persecutions and the Lord delivered me from them all. ###### v12 Now in fact all who want to live godly lives in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. ###### v13 But evil people and charlatans will go from bad to worse, deceiving others and being deceived themselves. ###### v14 You, however, must continue in the things you have learned and are confident about. You know who taught you ###### v15 and how from infancy you have known the holy writings, which are able to give you wisdom for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. ###### v16 Every scripture is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, ###### v17 that the person dedicated to God may be capable and equipped for every good work.
