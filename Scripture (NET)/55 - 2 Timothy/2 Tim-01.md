Salutation ###### 1 From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to further the promise of life in Christ Jesus, ###### v2 to Timothy, my dear child. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!Thanksgiving and Charge to Timothy ###### v3 I am thankful to God, whom I have served with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, when I remember you in my prayers as I do constantly night and day. ###### v4 As I remember your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. ###### v5 I recall your sincere faith that was alive first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you. ###### v6 Because of this I remind you to rekindle God's gift that you possess through the laying on of my hands. ###### v7 For God did not give us a Spirit of fear but of power and love and self-control. ###### v8 So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, a prisoner for his sake, but by God's power accept your share of suffering for the gospel. ###### v9 He is the one who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not based on our works but on his own purpose and grace, granted to us in Christ Jesus before time began, ###### v10 but now made visible through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He has broken the power of death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel! ###### v11 For this gospel I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher. ###### v12 Because of this, in fact, I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, because I know the one in whom my faith is set and I am convinced that he is able to protect what has been entrusted to me until that day. ###### v13 Hold to the standard of sound words that you heard from me and do so with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. ###### v14 Protect that good thing entrusted to you, through the Holy Spirit who lives within us. ###### v15 You know that everyone in the province of Asia deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. ###### v16 May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment. ###### v17 But when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me. ###### v18 May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well all the ways he served me in Ephesus.
