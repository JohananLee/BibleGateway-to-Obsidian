Serving Faithfully Despite Hardship ###### 1 So you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. ###### v2 And what you heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be competent to teach others as well. ###### v3 Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. ###### v4 No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him. ###### v5 Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he will not be crowned as the winner unless he competes according to the rules. ###### v6 The farmer who works hard ought to have the first share of the crops. ###### v7 Think about what I am saying and the Lord will give you understanding of all this. ###### v8 Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David; such is my gospel, ###### v9 for which I suffer hardship to the point of imprisonment as a criminal, but God's message is not imprisoned! ###### v10 So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God, that they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus and its eternal glory. ###### v11 This saying is trustworthy: If we died with him, we will also live with him. ###### v12 If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us. ###### v13 If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself.Dealing with False Teachers ###### v14 Remind people of these things and solemnly charge them before the Lord not to wrangle over words. This is of no benefit; it just brings ruin on those who listen. ###### v15 Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately. ###### v16 But avoid profane chatter, because those occupied with it will stray further and further into ungodliness, ###### v17 and their message will spread its infection like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are in this group. ###### v18 They have strayed from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining some people's faith. ###### v19 However, God's solid foundation remains standing, bearing this seal: "**_The Lord knows those who are his_**," and "Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from evil." ###### v20 Now in a wealthy home there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also ones made of wood and of clay, and some are for honorable use, but others for ignoble use. ###### v21 So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. ###### v22 But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart. ###### v23 But reject foolish and ignorant controversies, because you know they breed infighting. ###### v24 And the Lord's slave must not engage in heated disputes but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient, ###### v25 correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth ###### v26 and they will come to their senses and escape the devil's trap where they are held captive to do his will.
