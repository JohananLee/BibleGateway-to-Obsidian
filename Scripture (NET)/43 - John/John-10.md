Jesus as the Good Shepherd ###### 1 "I tell you the solemn truth, the one who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs in some other way, is a thief and a robber. ###### v2 The one who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. ###### v3 The doorkeeper opens the door for him, and the sheep hear his voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. ###### v4 When he has brought all his own sheep out, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice. ###### v5 They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him, because they do not recognize the stranger's voice." ###### v6 Jesus told them this parable, but they did not understand what he was saying to them. ###### v7 So Jesus said again, "I tell you the solemn truth, I am the door for the sheep. ###### v8 All who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not listen to them. ###### v9 I am the door. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved, and will come in and go out, and find pasture. ###### v10 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come so that they may have life, and may have it abundantly. ###### v11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. ###### v12 The hired hand, who is not a shepherd and does not own sheep, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and runs away. So the wolf attacks the sheep and scatters them. ###### v13 Because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep, he runs away. ###### v14 "I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me-- ###### v15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father--and I lay down my life for the sheep. ###### v16 I have other sheep that do not come from this sheepfold. I must bring them too, and they will listen to my voice, so that there will be one flock and one shepherd. ###### v17 This is why the Father loves me--because I lay down my life, so that I may take it back again. ###### v18 No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This commandment I received from my Father." ###### v19 Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words. ###### v20 Many of them were saying, "He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind! Why do you listen to him?" ###### v21 Others said, "These are not the words of someone possessed by a demon. A demon cannot cause the blind to see, can it?"Jesus at the Feast of Dedication ###### v22 Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem. ###### v23 It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon's Portico. ###### v24 The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked, "How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly." ###### v25 Jesus replied, "I told you and you do not believe. The deeds I do in my Father's name testify about me. ###### v26 But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep. ###### v27 My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. ###### v28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; no one will snatch them from my hand. ###### v29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them from my Father's hand. ###### v30 The Father and I are one." ###### v31 The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death. ###### v32 Jesus said to them, "I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?" ###### v33 The Jewish leaders replied, "We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God." ###### v34 Jesus answered, "Is it not written in your law, '**_I said, you are gods_**'? ###### v35 If those people to whom the word of God came were called 'gods' (and the scripture cannot be broken), ###### v36 do you say about the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'? ###### v37 If I do not perform the deeds of my Father, do not believe me. ###### v38 But if I do them, even if you do not believe me, believe the deeds, so that you may come to know and understand that I am in the Father and the Father is in me." ###### v39 Then they attempted again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches. ###### v40 Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there. ###### v41 Many came to him and began to say, "John performed no miraculous sign, but everything John said about this man was true!" ###### v42 And many believed in Jesus there.
