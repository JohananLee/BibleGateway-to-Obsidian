The Death of Lazarus ###### 1 Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. ###### v2 (Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) ###### v3 So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, "Lord, look, the one you love is sick." ###### v4 When Jesus heard this, he said, "This sickness will not lead to death, but to God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it." ###### v5 (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.) ###### v6 So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he remained in the place where he was for two more days. ###### v7 Then after this, he said to his disciples, "Let us go to Judea again." ###### v8 The disciples replied, "Rabbi, the Jewish leaders were just now trying to stone you to death! Are you going there again?" ###### v9 Jesus replied, "Are there not twelve hours in a day? If anyone walks around in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. ###### v10 But if anyone walks around at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him." ###### v11 After he said this, he added, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. But I am going there to awaken him." ###### v12 Then the disciples replied, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover." ###### v13 (Now Jesus had been talking about his death, but they thought he had been talking about real sleep.) ###### v14 Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus has died, ###### v15 and I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him." ###### v16 So Thomas (called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples, "Let us go too, so that we may die with him."Speaking with Martha and Mary ###### v17 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already. ###### v18 (Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, ###### v19 so many of the Jewish people of the region had come to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of their brother.) ###### v20 So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house. ###### v21 Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. ###### v22 But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will grant you." ###### v23 Jesus replied, "Your brother will come back to life again." ###### v24 Martha said, "I know that he will come back to life again in the resurrection at the last day." ###### v25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live even if he dies, ###### v26 and the one who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?" ###### v27 She replied, "Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world." ###### v28 And when she had said this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, saying privately, "The Teacher is here and is asking for you." ###### v29 So when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. ###### v30 (Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still in the place where Martha had come out to meet him.) ###### v31 Then the people who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out. They followed her, because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there. ###### v32 Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." ###### v33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping, he was intensely moved in spirit and greatly distressed. ###### v34 He asked, "Where have you laid him?" They replied, "Lord, come and see." ###### v35 Jesus wept. ###### v36 Thus the people who had come to mourn said, "Look how much he loved him!" ###### v37 But some of them said, "This is the man who caused the blind man to see! Couldn't he have done something to keep Lazarus from dying?"Lazarus Raised from the Dead ###### v38 Jesus, intensely moved again, came to the tomb. (Now it was a cave, and a stone was placed across it.) ###### v39 Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the deceased, replied, "Lord, by this time the body will have a bad smell, because he has been buried four days." ###### v40 Jesus responded, "Didn't I tell you that if you believe, you would see the glory of God?" ###### v41 So they took away the stone. Jesus looked upward and said, "Father, I thank you that you have listened to me. ###### v42 I knew that you always listen to me, but I said this for the sake of the crowd standing around here, that they may believe that you sent me." ###### v43 When he had said this, he shouted in a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!" ###### v44 The one who had died came out, his feet and hands tied up with strips of cloth, and a cloth wrapped around his face. Jesus said to them, "Unwrap him and let him go."The Response of the Jewish Leaders ###### v45 Then many of the people, who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in him. ###### v46 But some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done. ###### v47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said, "What are we doing? For this man is performing many miraculous signs. ###### v48 If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our sanctuary and our nation." ###### v49 Then one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said, "You know nothing at all! ###### v50 You do not realize that it is more to your advantage to have one man die for the people than for the whole nation to perish." ###### v51 (Now he did not say this on his own, but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation, ###### v52 and not for the Jewish nation only, but to gather together into one the children of God who are scattered.) ###### v53 So from that day they planned together to kill him. ###### v54 Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples. ###### v55 Now the Jewish Feast of Passover was near, and many people went up to Jerusalem from the rural areas before the Passover to cleanse themselves ritually. ###### v56 Thus they were looking for Jesus, and saying to one another as they stood in the temple courts, "What do you think? That he won't come to the feast?" ###### v57 (Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it, so that they could arrest him.)
