Burning a Useless Vine ###### 1 The Lord's message came to me: ###### v2 "Son of man, of all the woody branches among the trees of the forest, what happens to the wood of the vine? ###### v3 Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on? ###### v4 No! It is thrown in the fire for fuel; when the fire has burned up both ends of it and it is charred in the middle, will it be useful for anything? ###### v5 Indeed! If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole, how much less can it be made into anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred? ###### v6 "Therefore, this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Like the wood of the vine is among the trees of the forest that I have provided as fuel for the fire--so I will provide the residents of Jerusalem as fuel. ###### v7 I will set my face against them--although they have escaped from the fire, the fire will still consume them! Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them. ###### v8 I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Sovereign LORD."
