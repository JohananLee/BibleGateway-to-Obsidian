Ezekiel's Commission ###### 1 He said to me, "Son of man, stand on your feet and I will speak with you." ###### v2 As he spoke to me, a wind came into me and stood me on my feet, and I heard the one speaking to me. ###### v3 He said to me, "Son of man, I am sending you to the house of Israel, to rebellious nations who have rebelled against me; both they and their fathers have revolted against me to this very day. ###### v4 The people to whom I am sending you are obstinate and hard-hearted, and you must say to them, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says.' ###### v5 And as for them, whether they listen or not--for they are a rebellious house--they will know that a prophet has been among them. ###### v6 But you, son of man, do not fear them, and do not fear their words. Even though briers and thorns surround you and you live among scorpions--do not fear their words and do not be terrified of the looks they give you, for they are a rebellious house! ###### v7 You must speak my words to them whether they listen or not, for they are rebellious. ###### v8 As for you, son of man, listen to what I am saying to you: Do not rebel like that rebellious house! Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you." ###### v9 Then I looked and realized a hand was stretched out to me, and in it was a written scroll. ###### v10 He unrolled it before me, and it had writing on the front and back; written on it were laments, mourning, and woe.
