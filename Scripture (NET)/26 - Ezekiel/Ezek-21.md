The Sword of Judgment ###### 1 (21:6) The Lord's message came to me: ###### v2 "Son of man, turn toward Jerusalem and speak out against the sanctuaries. Prophesy against the land of Israel ###### v3 and say to them, 'This is what the LORD says: Look, I am against you. I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked. ###### v4 Because I will cut off from you both the righteous and the wicked, my sword will go out from its sheath against everyone from the south to the north. ###### v5 Then everyone will know that I am the LORD, who drew my sword from its sheath--it will not be sheathed again!' ###### v6 "And you, son of man, groan with an aching heart and bitterness; groan before their eyes. ###### v7 When they ask you, 'Why are you groaning?' you will reply, 'Because of the report that has come. Every heart will melt with fear and every hand will be limp; everyone will faint, and every knee will be wet with urine.' Pay attention--it is coming and it will happen, declares the Sovereign LORD." ###### v8 The Lord's message came to me: ###### v9 "Son of man, prophesy and say: 'This is what the Lord says: "'A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also polished. ###### v10 It is sharpened for slaughter, it is polished to flash like lightning! "'Should we rejoice in the scepter of my son? No! The sword despises every tree! ###### v11 "'He gave it to be polished, to be grasped in the hand-- the sword is sharpened, it is polished-- giving it into the hand of the executioner. ###### v12 Cry out and moan, son of man, for it is wielded against my people; against all the princes of Israel. They are delivered up to the sword, along with my people. Therefore, strike your thigh. ###### v13 "'For testing will come, and what will happen when the scepter, which the sword despises, is no more? declares the Sovereign LORD.' ###### v14 "And you, son of man, prophesy, and clap your hands together. Let the sword strike twice, even three times! It is a sword for slaughter, a sword for the great slaughter surrounding them. ###### v15 So hearts melt with fear and many stumble. At all their gates I have stationed the sword for slaughter. Ah! It is made to flash, it is drawn for slaughter! ###### v16 Cut sharply on the right! Swing to the left, wherever your edge is appointed to strike. ###### v17 I too will clap my hands together, I will exhaust my rage; I the LORD have spoken." ###### v18 The Lord's message came to me: ###### v19 "You, son of man, mark out two routes for the king of Babylon's sword to take; both of them will originate in a single land. Make a signpost and put it at the beginning of the road leading to the city. ###### v20 Mark out the routes for the sword to take: 'Rabbah of the Ammonites' and 'Judah with Jerusalem in it.' ###### v21 For the king of Babylon stands at the fork in the road at the head of the two routes. He looks for omens: He shakes arrows, he consults idols, he examines animal livers. ###### v22 Into his right hand comes the portent for Jerusalem--to set up battering rams, to give the signal for slaughter, to shout out the battle cry, to set up battering rams against the gates, to erect a siege ramp, to build a siege wall. ###### v23 But those in Jerusalem will view it as a false omen. They have sworn solemn oaths, but the king of Babylon will accuse them of violations in order to seize them. ###### v24 "Therefore this is what the Sovereign LORD says: 'Because you have brought up your own guilt by uncovering your transgressions and revealing your sins through all your actions, for this reason you will be taken by force. ###### v25 "'As for you, profane and wicked prince of Israel, whose day has come, the time of final punishment, ###### v26 this is what the Sovereign LORD says: Tear off the turban; take off the crown! Things must change. Exalt the lowly; bring low the exalted! ###### v27 A total ruin I will make it! Indeed, this will not be until he comes to whom is the right, and I will give it to him.' ###### v28 "As for you, son of man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Sovereign LORD says concerning the Ammonites and their coming humiliation: "'A sword, a sword drawn for slaughter, polished to consume, to flash like lightning-- ###### v29 while seeing false visions about you and reading lying omens about you-- to place you on the necks of the profane wicked, whose day has come, the time of final punishment. ###### v30 Return it to its sheath! In the place where you were created, in your native land, I will judge you. ###### v31 I will pour out my anger on you; the fire of my fury I will blow on you. I will hand you over to brutal men, who are skilled in destruction. ###### v32 You will become fuel for the fire-- your blood will stain the middle of the land; you will no longer be remembered, for I, the LORD, have spoken.'"
