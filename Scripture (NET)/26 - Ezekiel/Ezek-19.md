Lament for the Princes of Israel ###### 1 "And you, sing a lament for the princes of Israel, ###### v2 and say: "'What a lioness was your mother among the lions! She lay among young lions; she reared her cubs. ###### v3 She reared one of her cubs; he became a young lion. He learned to tear prey; he devoured people. ###### v4 The nations heard about him; he was trapped in their pit. They brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt. ###### v5 "'When she realized that she waited in vain, her hope was lost. She took another of her cubs and made him a young lion. ###### v6 He walked about among the lions; he became a young lion. He learned to tear prey; he devoured people. ###### v7 He broke down their strongholds and devastated their cities. The land and everything in it was frightened at the sound of his roaring. ###### v8 The nations--the surrounding regions--attacked him. They threw their net over him; he was caught in their pit. ###### v9 They put him in a collar with hooks; they brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him to prison so that his voice would not be heard any longer on the mountains of Israel. ###### v10 "'Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard, planted by water. It was fruitful and full of branches because it was well-watered. ###### v11 Its boughs were strong, fit for rulers' scepters; it reached up into the clouds. It stood out because of its height and its many branches. ###### v12 But it was plucked up in anger; it was thrown down to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit; its strong branches broke off and withered-- a fire consumed them. ###### v13 Now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land. ###### v14 A fire has gone out from its branch; it has consumed its shoot and its fruit. No strong branch was left in it, nor a scepter to rule.' "This is a lament song, and has become a lament song."
