Jesus Brought Before Pilate ###### 1 Then the whole group of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate. ###### v2 They began to accuse him, saying, "We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar and claiming that he himself is Christ, a king." ###### v3 So Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He replied, "You say so." ###### v4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no basis for an accusation against this man." ###### v5 But they persisted in saying, "He incites the people by teaching throughout all Judea. It started in Galilee and ended up here!"Jesus Brought Before Herod ###### v6 Now when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ###### v7 When he learned that he was from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who also happened to be in Jerusalem at that time. ###### v8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some miraculous sign. ###### v9 So Herod questioned him at considerable length; Jesus gave him no answer. ###### v10 The chief priests and the experts in the law were there, vehemently accusing him. ###### v11 Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, dressing him in elegant clothes, Herod sent him back to Pilate. ###### v12 That very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other, for prior to this they had been enemies.Jesus Brought Before the Crowd ###### v13 Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people, ###### v14 and said to them, "You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. When I examined him before you, I did not find this man guilty of anything you accused him of doing. ###### v15 Neither did Herod, for he sent him back to us. Look, he has done nothing deserving death. ###### v16 I will therefore have him flogged and release him." ###### v18 But they all shouted out together, "Take this man away! Release Barabbas for us!" ###### v19 (This was a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city, and for murder.) ###### v20 Pilate addressed them once again because he wanted to release Jesus. ###### v21 But they kept on shouting, "Crucify, crucify him!" ###### v22 A third time he said to them, "Why? What wrong has he done? I have found him guilty of no crime deserving death. I will therefore flog him and release him." ###### v23 But they were insistent, demanding with loud shouts that he be crucified. And their shouts prevailed. ###### v24 So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted. ###### v25 He released the man they asked for, who had been thrown in prison for insurrection and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.The Crucifixion ###### v26 As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country. They placed the cross on his back and made him carry it behind Jesus. ###### v27 A great number of the people followed him, among them women who were mourning and wailing for him. ###### v28 But Jesus turned to them and said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children. ###### v29 For this is certain: The days are coming when they will say, 'Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore children, and the breasts that never nursed!' ###### v30 Then they will begin _to say to the mountains,_ '_Fall on us!_' _and_ _to the hills,_ '_Cover us!_' ###### v31 For if such things are done when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?" ###### v32 Two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him. ###### v33 So when they came to the place that is called "The Skull," they crucified him there, along with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. ###### v34 [But Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing."] Then _they threw dice_ _to divide his clothes_. ###### v35 The people also stood there watching, but the leaders ridiculed him, saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself if he is the Christ of God, his chosen one!" ###### v36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine, ###### v37 and saying, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!" ###### v38 There was also an inscription over him, "This is the king of the Jews." ###### v39 One of the criminals who was hanging there railed at him, saying, "Aren't you the Christ? Save yourself and us!" ###### v40 But the other rebuked him, saying, "Don't you fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation? ###### v41 And we rightly so, for we are getting what we deserve for what we did, but this man has done nothing wrong." ###### v42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom." ###### v43 And Jesus said to him, "I tell you the truth, today you will be with me in paradise." ###### v44 It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon, ###### v45 because the sun's light failed. The temple curtain was torn in two. ###### v46 Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "Father, **_into_** **_your hands I commit my spirit!_**" And after he said this he breathed his last. ###### v47 Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he praised God and said, "Certainly this man was innocent!" ###### v48 And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home beating their breasts. ###### v49 And all those who knew Jesus stood at a distance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee saw these things.Jesus' Burial ###### v50 Now there was a man named Joseph who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man. ###### v51 (He had not consented to their plan and action.) He was from the Judean town of Arimathea, and was looking forward to the kingdom of God. ###### v52 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. ###### v53 Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock, where no one had yet been buried. ###### v54 It was the day of preparation and the Sabbath was beginning. ###### v55 The women who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it. ###### v56 Then they returned and prepared aromatic spices and perfumes. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
