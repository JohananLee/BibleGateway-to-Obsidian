Jesus and Zacchaeus ###### 1 Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. ###### v2 Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. ###### v3 He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd. ###### v4 So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way. ###### v5 And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him, "Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because I must stay at your house today." ###### v6 So he came down quickly and welcomed Jesus joyfully. ###### v7 And when the people saw it, they all complained, "He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner." ###### v8 But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, half of my possessions I now give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back four times as much!" ###### v9 Then Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this household, because he too is a son of Abraham! ###### v10 For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost."The Parable of the Ten Minas ###### v11 While the people were listening to these things, Jesus proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately. ###### v12 Therefore he said, "A nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. ###### v13 And he summoned ten of his slaves, gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Do business with these until I come back.' ###### v14 But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We do not want this man to be king over us!' ###### v15 When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he summoned these slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much they had earned by trading. ###### v16 So the first one came before him and said, 'Sir, your mina has made ten minas more.' ###### v17 And the king said to him, 'Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small matter, you will have authority over ten cities.' ###### v18 Then the second one came and said, 'Sir, your mina has made five minas.' ###### v19 So the king said to him, 'And you are to be over five cities.' ###### v20 Then another slave came and said, 'Sir, here is your mina that I put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth. ###### v21 For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man. You withdraw what you did not deposit and reap what you did not sow.' ###### v22 The king said to him, 'I will judge you by your own words, you wicked slave! So you knew, did you, that I was a severe man, withdrawing what I didn't deposit and reaping what I didn't sow? ###### v23 Why then didn't you put my money in the bank, so that when I returned I could have collected it with interest?' ###### v24 And he said to his attendants, 'Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten.' ###### v25 But they said to him, 'Sir, he has ten minas already!' ###### v26 'I tell you that everyone who has will be given more, but from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. ###### v27 But as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to be their king, bring them here and slaughter them in front of me!'"The Triumphal Entry ###### v28 After Jesus had said this, he continued on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. ###### v29 Now when he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, ###### v30 telling them, "Go to the village ahead of you. When you enter it, you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here. ###### v31 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you untying it?' just say, 'The Lord needs it.'" ###### v32 So those who were sent ahead found it exactly as he had told them. ###### v33 As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying that colt?" ###### v34 They replied, "The Lord needs it." ###### v35 Then they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and had Jesus get on it. ###### v36 As he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. ###### v37 As he approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen: ###### v38 "**_Blessed is the king_** **_who comes in the name of the Lord!_** Peace in heaven and glory in the highest!" ###### v39 But some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, rebuke your disciples." ###### v40 He answered, "I tell you, if they keep silent, the very stones will cry out!"Jesus Weeps for Jerusalem under Judgment ###### v41 Now when Jesus approached and saw the city, he wept over it, ###### v42 saying, "If you had only known on this day, even you, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. ###### v43 For the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and surround you and close in on you from every side. ###### v44 They will demolish you--you and your children within your walls--and they will not leave within you one stone on top of another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God."Cleansing the Temple ###### v45 Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling things there, ###### v46 saying to them, "It is written, '**_My house will be a house of prayer_**,' but you have turned it into **_a den_** **_of robbers_**!" ###### v47 Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts. The chief priests and the experts in the law and the prominent leaders among the people were seeking to assassinate him, ###### v48 but they could not find a way to do it, for all the people hung on his words.
