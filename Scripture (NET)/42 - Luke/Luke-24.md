The Resurrection ###### 1 Now on the first day of the week, at early dawn, the women went to the tomb, taking the aromatic spices they had prepared. ###### v2 They found that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb, ###### v3 but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. ###### v4 While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood beside them in dazzling attire. ###### v5 The women were terribly frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, "Why do you look for the living among the dead? ###### v6 He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, ###### v7 that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again." ###### v8 Then the women remembered his words, ###### v9 and when they returned from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. ###### v10 Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles. ###### v11 But these words seemed like pure nonsense to them, and they did not believe them. ###### v12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. He bent down and saw only the strips of linen cloth; then he went home, wondering what had happened.Jesus Walks the Road to Emmaus ###### v13 Now that very day two of them were on their way to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. ###### v14 They were talking to each other about all the things that had happened. ###### v15 While they were talking and debating these things, Jesus himself approached and began to accompany them ###### v16 (but their eyes were kept from recognizing him). ###### v17 Then he said to them, "What are these matters you are discussing so intently as you walk along?" And they stood still, looking sad. ###### v18 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know the things that have happened there in these days?" ###### v19 He said to them, "What things?" "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene," they replied, "a man who, with his powerful deeds and words, proved to be a prophet before God and all the people; ###### v20 and how our chief priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and crucified him. ###### v21 But we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. Not only this, but it is now the third day since these things happened. ###### v22 Furthermore, some women of our group amazed us. They were at the tomb early this morning, ###### v23 and when they did not find his body, they came back and said they had seen a vision of angels, who said he was alive. ###### v24 Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women had said, but they did not see him." ###### v25 So he said to them, "You foolish people--how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! ###### v26 Wasn't it necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into his glory?" ###### v27 Then beginning with Moses and all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things written about himself in all the scriptures. ###### v28 So they approached the village where they were going. He acted as though he wanted to go farther, ###### v29 but they urged him, "Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening and the day is almost done." So he went in to stay with them. ###### v30 When he had taken his place at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them. ###### v31 At this point their eyes were opened and they recognized him. Then he vanished out of their sight. ###### v32 They said to each other, "Didn't our hearts burn within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?" ###### v33 So they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. They found the eleven and those with them gathered together ###### v34 and saying, "The Lord has really risen, and has appeared to Simon!" ###### v35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and how they recognized him when he broke the bread.Jesus Makes a Final Appearance ###### v36 While they were saying these things, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you." ###### v37 But they were startled and terrified, thinking they saw a ghost. ###### v38 Then he said to them, "Why are you frightened, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? ###### v39 Look at my hands and my feet; it's me! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones like you see I have." ###### v40 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet. ###### v41 And while they still could not believe it (because of their joy) and were amazed, he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?" ###### v42 So they gave him a piece of broiled fish, ###### v43 and he took it and ate it in front of them.Jesus' Final Commission ###### v44 Then he said to them, "These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled." ###### v45 Then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures, ###### v46 and said to them, "Thus it stands written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day, ###### v47 and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all nations, beginning from Jerusalem. ###### v48 You are witnesses of these things. ###### v49 And look, I am sending you what my Father promised. But stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."Jesus' Departure ###### v50 Then Jesus led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. ###### v51 Now during the blessing he departed and was taken up into heaven. ###### v52 So they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, ###### v53 and were continually in the temple courts blessing God.
