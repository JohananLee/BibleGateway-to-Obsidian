False Prophets in the Family ###### v6 Suppose your own full brother, your son, your daughter, your beloved wife, or your closest friend should seduce you secretly and encourage you to go and serve other gods that neither you nor your ancestors have previously known, ###### v7 the gods of the surrounding people (whether near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other). ###### v8 You must not give in to him or even listen to him; do not feel sympathy for him or spare him or cover up for him. ###### v9 Instead, you must kill him without fail! Your own hand must be the first to strike him, and then the hands of the whole community. ###### v10 You must stone him to death because he tried to entice you away from the LORD your God, who delivered you from the land of Egypt, that place of slavery. ###### v11 Thus all Israel will hear and be afraid; no longer will they continue to do evil like this among you.Punishment of Community Idolatry ###### v12 Suppose you should hear in one of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you as a place to live, that ###### v13 some evil people have departed from among you to entice the inhabitants of their cities, saying, "Let's go and serve other gods" (whom you have not known before). ###### v14 You must investigate thoroughly and inquire carefully. If it is indeed true that such a disgraceful thing is being done among you, ###### v15 you must by all means slaughter the inhabitants of that city with the sword; annihilate with the sword everyone in it, as well as the livestock. ###### v16 You must gather all of its plunder into the middle of the plaza and burn the city and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It will be an abandoned ruin forever--it must never be rebuilt again. ###### v17 You must not take for yourself anything that has been placed under judgment. Then the LORD will relent from his intense anger, show you compassion, have mercy on you, and multiply you as he promised your ancestors. ###### v18 Thus you must obey the LORD your God, keeping all his commandments that I am giving you today and doing what is right before him.
