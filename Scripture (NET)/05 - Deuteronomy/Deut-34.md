The Death of Moses ###### 1 Then Moses ascended from the rift valley plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the summit of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. The LORD showed him the whole land--Gilead to Dan, ###### v2 and all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the distant sea, ###### v3 the Negev, and the plain of the Valley of Jericho, the city of date palm trees, as far as Zoar. ###### v4 Then the LORD said to him, "This is the land I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it, but you will not cross over there." ###### v5 So Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab as the LORD had said. ###### v6 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab near Beth Peor, but no one knows his exact burial place to this very day. ###### v7 Moses was 120 years old when he died, but his eye was not dull nor had his vitality departed. ###### v8 The Israelites mourned for Moses in the rift valley plains of Moab for thirty days; then the days of mourning for Moses ended.An Epitaph for Moses ###### v9 Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had placed his hands on him; and the Israelites listened to him and did just what the LORD had commanded Moses. ###### v10 No prophet ever again arose in Israel like Moses, who knew the LORD face to face. ###### v11 He did all the signs and wonders the LORD had sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, all his servants, and the whole land, ###### v12 and he displayed great power and awesome might in view of all Israel.
