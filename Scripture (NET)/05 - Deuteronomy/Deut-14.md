The Holy and the Profane ###### 1 You are children of the LORD your God. Do not cut yourselves or shave your forehead bald for the sake of the dead. ###### v2 For you are a people holy to the LORD your God. He has chosen you to be his people, prized above all others on the face of the earth. ###### v3 You must not eat any forbidden thing. ###### v4 These are the animals you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, ###### v5 the ibex, the gazelle, the deer, the wild goat, the antelope, the wild oryx, and the mountain sheep. ###### v6 You may eat any animal that has hooves divided into two parts and that chews the cud. ###### v7 However, you may not eat the following animals among those that chew the cud or those that have divided hooves: the camel, the hare, and the rock badger. (Although they chew the cud, they do not have divided hooves and are therefore ritually impure to you.) ###### v8 Also, the pig is ritually impure to you; though it has divided hooves, it does not chew the cud. You may not eat their meat or even touch their remains. ###### v9 These you may eat from among water creatures: anything with fins and scales you may eat, ###### v10 but whatever does not have fins and scales you may not eat; it is ritually impure to you. ###### v11 All ritually clean birds you may eat. ###### v12 These are the ones you may not eat: the eagle, the vulture, the black vulture, ###### v13 the kite, the black kite, the dayyah after its species, ###### v14 every raven after its species, ###### v15 the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the falcon after its species, ###### v16 the little owl, the long-eared owl, the white owl, ###### v17 the jackdaw, the carrion vulture, the cormorant, ###### v18 the stork, the heron after its species, the hoopoe, and the bat. ###### v19 And any swarming winged thing is impure to you--they may not be eaten. ###### v20 You may eat any winged creature that is clean. ###### v21 You may not eat any corpse, though you may give it to the resident foreigner who is living in your villages and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. You are a people holy to the LORD your God. Do not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.The Offering of Tithes ###### v22 You must be certain to tithe all the produce of your seed that comes from the field year after year. ###### v23 In the presence of the LORD your God, in the place he chooses to locate his name, you must eat from the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your olive oil, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks, so that you may learn to revere the LORD your God always. ###### v24 When he blesses you, if the place where he chooses to locate his name is distant, ###### v25 you may convert the tithe into money, secure the money, and travel to the place the LORD your God chooses for himself. ###### v26 Then you may spend the money however you wish for cattle, sheep, wine, beer, or whatever you desire. You and your household may eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and enjoy it. ###### v27 As for the Levites in your villages, you must not ignore them, for they have no allotment or inheritance along with you. ###### v28 At the end of every three years you must bring all the tithe of your produce, in that very year, and you must store it up in your villages. ###### v29 Then the Levites (because they have no allotment or inheritance with you), the resident foreigners, the orphans, and the widows of your villages may come and eat their fill so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work you do.
