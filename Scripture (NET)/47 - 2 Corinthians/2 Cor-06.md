God's Suffering Servants ###### 1 Now because we are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain. ###### v2 For he says, "**_I heard you at the acceptable time, and in the day of salvation I helped you_**." Look, now is **_the acceptable time_**; look, now is **_the day of salvation_**! ###### v3 We do not give anyone an occasion for taking an offense in anything, so that no fault may be found with our ministry. ###### v4 But as God's servants, we have commended ourselves in every way, with great endurance, in persecutions, in difficulties, in distresses, ###### v5 in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in troubles, in sleepless nights, in hunger, ###### v6 by purity, by knowledge, by patience, by benevolence, by the Holy Spirit, by genuine love, ###### v7 by truthful teaching, by the power of God, with weapons of righteousness both for the right hand and for the left, ###### v8 through glory and dishonor, through slander and praise; regarded as impostors, and yet true; ###### v9 as unknown, and yet well-known; as dying and yet--see!--we continue to live; as those who are scourged and yet not executed; ###### v10 as sorrowful, but always rejoicing, as poor, but making many rich, as having nothing, and yet possessing everything. ###### v11 We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart has been opened wide to you. ###### v12 Our affection for you is not restricted, but you are restricted in your affections for us. ###### v13 Now as a fair exchange--I speak as to my children--open wide your hearts to us also.Unequal Partners ###### v14 Do not become partners with those who do not believe, for what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship does light have with darkness? ###### v15 And what agreement does Christ have with Beliar? Or what does a believer share in common with an unbeliever? ###### v16 And what mutual agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, "**_I will live in them_** **_and_** **_will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people_**." ###### v17 Therefore "**_come out from their midst, and be separate_**," says the Lord, "**_and_** _**touch no unclean thing**,_ _and_ _I will welcome_ _you_, ###### v18 _and_ _I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters_," says the All-Powerful Lord.
