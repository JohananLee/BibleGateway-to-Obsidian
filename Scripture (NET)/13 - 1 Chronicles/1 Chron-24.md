David Organizes the Priests ###### 1 The divisions of Aaron's descendants were as follows: The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. ###### v2 Nadab and Abihu died before their father did; they had no sons. Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests. ###### v3 David, Zadok (a descendant of Eleazar), and Ahimelech (a descendant of Ithamar) divided them into groups to carry out their assigned responsibilities. ###### v4 The descendants of Eleazar had more leaders than the descendants of Ithamar, so they divided them up accordingly; the descendants of Eleazar had sixteen leaders, while the descendants of Ithamar had eight. ###### v5 They divided them by lots, for there were officials of the Holy Place and officials designated by God among the descendants of both Eleazar and Ithamar. ###### v6 The scribe Shemaiah son of Nethanel, a Levite, wrote down their names before the king, the officials, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the priestly and Levite families. One family was drawn by lot from Eleazar, and then the next from Ithamar. ###### v7 The first lot went to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, ###### v8 the third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, ###### v9 the fifth to Malkijah, the sixth to Mijamin, ###### v10 the seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, ###### v11 the ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, ###### v12 the eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, ###### v13 the thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, ###### v14 the fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, ###### v15 the seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Happizzez, ###### v16 the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel, ###### v17 the twenty-first to Jakin, the twenty-second to Gamul, ###### v18 the twenty-third to Delaiah, the twenty-fourth to Maaziah. ###### v19 This was the order in which they carried out their assigned responsibilities when they entered the LORD's temple, according to the regulations given them by their ancestor Aaron, just as the LORD God of Israel had instructed him.Remaining Levites ###### v20 The rest of the Levites included: Shubael from the sons of Amram, Jehdeiah from the sons of Shubael, ###### v21 the firstborn Isshiah from Rehabiah and the sons of Rehabiah, ###### v22 Shelomoth from the Izharites, Jahath from the sons of Shelomoth. ###### v23 The sons of Hebron: Jeriah, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth. ###### v24 The son of Uzziel: Micah; Shamir from the sons of Micah. ###### v25 The brother of Micah: Isshiah. Zechariah from the sons of Isshiah. ###### v26 The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. The son of Jaaziah: Beno. ###### v27 The sons of Merari, from Jaaziah: Beno, Shoham, Zaccur, and Ibri. ###### v28 From Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons. ###### v29 From Kish: Jerahmeel. ###### v30 The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the Levites, listed by their families. ###### v31 Like their relatives, the descendants of Aaron, they also cast lots before King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, the leaders of families, the priests, and the Levites. The families of the oldest son cast lots along with those of the youngest.
