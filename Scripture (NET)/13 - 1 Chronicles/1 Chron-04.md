His mother had named him Jabez, for she said, "I experienced pain when I gave birth to him." ###### v10 Jabez called out to the God of Israel, "If only you would greatly bless me and expand my territory. May your hand be with me! Keep me from harm so I might not endure pain." God answered his prayer. ###### v11 Kelub, the brother of Shuhah, was the father of Mehir, who was the father of Eshton. ###### v12 Eshton was the father of Beth Rapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah, the father of Ir Nahash. These were the men of Recah. ###### v13 The sons of Kenaz: Othniel and Seraiah. The sons of Othniel: Hathath and Meonothai. ###### v14 Meonothai was the father of Ophrah.

But his brothers did not have many sons, so their whole clan was not as numerous as the sons of Judah. ###### v28 They lived in Beer Sheba, Moladah, Hazar Shual, ###### v29 Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, ###### v30 Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, ###### v31 Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susim, Beth Biri, and Shaaraim.

Their extended families increased greatly in numbers. ###### v39 They went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east of the valley, looking for pasture for their sheep. ###### v40 They found fertile and rich pasture; the land was very broad, undisturbed and peaceful. Indeed some Hamites had been living there before that. ###### v41 The men whose names are listed came during the time of King Hezekiah of Judah and attacked the Hamites' settlements, as well as the Meunites they discovered there, and they wiped them out, as can be seen to this very day. They dispossessed them, for they found pasture for their sheep there. ###### v42 Five hundred men of Simeon, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to the hill country of Seir ###### v43 and defeated the rest of the Amalekite refugees; they live there to this very day.
