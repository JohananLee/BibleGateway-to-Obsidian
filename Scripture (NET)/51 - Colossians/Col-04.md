Exhortation to Pray for the Success of Paul's Mission ###### v2 Be devoted to prayer, keeping alert in it with thanksgiving. ###### v3 At the same time pray for us too, that God may open a door for the message so that we may proclaim the mystery of Christ, for which I am in chains. ###### v4 Pray that I may make it known as I should. ###### v5 Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunities. ###### v6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you should answer everyone.Personal Greetings and Instructions ###### v7 Tychicus, a dear brother, faithful minister, and fellow slave in the Lord, will tell you all the news about me. ###### v8 I sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts. ###### v9 I sent him with Onesimus, the faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you about everything here. ###### v10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him). ###### v11 And Jesus who is called Justus also sends greetings. In terms of Jewish converts, these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me. ###### v12 Epaphras, who is one of you and a slave of Christ, greets you. He is always struggling in prayer on your behalf, so that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God. ###### v13 For I can testify that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis. ###### v14 Our dear friend Luke the physician and Demas greet you. ###### v15 Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters who are in Laodicea and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house. ###### v16 And after you have read this letter, have it read to the church of Laodicea. In turn, read the letter from Laodicea as well. ###### v17 And tell Archippus, "See to it that you complete the ministry you received in the Lord." ###### v18 I, Paul, write this greeting by my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.
