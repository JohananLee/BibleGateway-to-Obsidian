###### 1 One dead fly makes the perfumer's ointment give off a rancid stench, so a little folly can outweigh much wisdom.Wisdom Can Be Nullified By the Caprice of Rulers ###### v2 A wise person's good sense protects him, but a fool's lack of sense leaves him vulnerable. ###### v3 Even when a fool walks along the road he lacks sense, and shows everyone what a fool he is. ###### v4 If the anger of the ruler flares up against you, do not resign from your position, for a calm response can undo great offenses. ###### v5 I have seen another misfortune on the earth: It is an error a ruler makes. ###### v6 Fools are placed in many positions of authority, while wealthy men sit in lowly positions. ###### v7 I have seen slaves on horseback and princes walking on foot like slaves.Wisdom is Needed to Avert Dangers in Everyday Life ###### v8 One who digs a pit may fall into it, and one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake. ###### v9 One who quarries stones may be injured by them; one who splits logs may be endangered by them. ###### v10 If an iron axhead is blunt and a workman does not sharpen its edge, he must exert a great deal of effort; so wisdom has the advantage of giving success. ###### v11 If the snake should bite before it is charmed, the snake charmer is in trouble.Words and Works of Wise Men and Fools ###### v12 The words of a wise person win him favor, but the words of a fool are self-destructive. ###### v13 At the beginning his words are foolish and at the end his talk is wicked madness, ###### v14 yet a fool keeps on babbling. No one knows what will happen; who can tell him what will happen in the future? ###### v15 The toil of a stupid fool wears him out, because he does not even know the way to the city.The Problem with Foolish Rulers ###### v16 Woe to you, O land, when your king is childish, and your princes feast in the morning. ###### v17 Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobility, and your princes feast at the proper time--with self-control and not in drunkenness. ###### v18 Because of laziness the roof caves in, and because of idle hands the house leaks. ###### v19 Feasts are made for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything. ###### v20 Do not curse a king even in your thoughts, and do not curse the rich while in your bedroom; for a bird might report what you are thinking, or some winged creature might repeat your words.
