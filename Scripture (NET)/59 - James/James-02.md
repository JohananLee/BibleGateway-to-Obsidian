Prejudice and the Law of Love ###### 1 My brothers and sisters, do not show prejudice if you possess faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. ###### v2 For if someone comes into your assembly wearing a gold ring and fine clothing, and a poor person enters in filthy clothes, ###### v3 do you pay attention to the one who is finely dressed and say, "You sit here in a good place," and to the poor person, "You stand over there," or "Sit on the floor"? ###### v4 If so, have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives? ###### v5 Listen, my dear brothers and sisters! Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? ###### v6 But you have dishonored the poor! Are not the rich oppressing you and dragging you into the courts? ###### v7 Do they not blaspheme the good name of the one you belong to? ###### v8 But if you fulfill the royal law as expressed in this scripture, "**_You shall love your neighbor as yourself_**," you are doing well. ###### v9 But if you show prejudice, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as violators. ###### v10 For the one who obeys the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. ###### v11 For he who said, "**_Do not commit adultery_**," also said, "**_Do not murder_**." Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a violator of the law. ###### v12 Speak and act as those who will be judged by a law that gives freedom. ###### v13 For judgment is merciless for the one who has shown no mercy. But mercy triumphs over judgment.Faith and Works Together ###### v14 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can this kind of faith save him? ###### v15 If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacks daily food, ###### v16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm and eat well," but you do not give them what the body needs, what good is it? ###### v17 So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead being by itself. ###### v18 But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith without works and I will show you faith by my works. ###### v19 You believe that God is one; well and good. Even the demons believe that--and tremble with fear. ###### v20 But would you like evidence, you empty fellow, that faith without works is useless? ###### v21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? ###### v22 You see that his faith was working together with his works and his faith was perfected by works. ###### v23 And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "**_Now Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness_**," and _he was called God's friend_. ###### v24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. ###### v25 And similarly, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another way? ###### v26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
