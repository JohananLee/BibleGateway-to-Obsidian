The Power of the Tongue ###### 1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, because you know that we will be judged more strictly. ###### v2 For we all stumble in many ways. If someone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect individual, able to control the entire body as well. ###### v3 And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to get them to obey us, then we guide their entire bodies. ###### v4 Look at ships too: Though they are so large and driven by harsh winds, they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot's inclination directs. ###### v5 So too the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it has great pretensions. Think how small a flame sets a huge forest ablaze. ###### v6 And the tongue is a fire! The tongue represents the world of wrongdoing among the parts of our bodies. It pollutes the entire body and sets fire to the course of human existence--and is set on fire by hell. ###### v7 For every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is subdued and has been subdued by humankind. ###### v8 But no human being can subdue the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. ###### v9 With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse people made in God's image. ###### v10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. These things should not be so, my brothers and sisters. ###### v11 A spring does not pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening, does it? ###### v12 Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters, or a vine produce figs? Neither can a salt water spring produce fresh water.True Wisdom ###### v13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct he should show his works done in the gentleness that wisdom brings. ###### v14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth. ###### v15 Such wisdom does not come from above but is earthly, natural, demonic. ###### v16 For where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is disorder and every evil practice. ###### v17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and not hypocritical. ###### v18 And the fruit that consists of righteousness is planted in peace among those who make peace.
