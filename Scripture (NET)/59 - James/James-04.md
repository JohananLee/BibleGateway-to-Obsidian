Passions and Pride ###### 1 Where do the conflicts and where do the quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this, from your passions that battle inside you? ###### v2 You desire and you do not have; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain; you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask; ###### v3 you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly, so you can spend it on your passions. ###### v4 Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God? So whoever decides to be the world's friend makes himself God's enemy. ###### v5 Or do you think the scripture means nothing when it says, "The spirit that God caused to live within us has an envious yearning"? ###### v6 But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, "**_God opposes the proud, but he gives grace to the humble_**." ###### v7 So submit to God. But resist the devil and he will flee from you. ###### v8 Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you double-minded. ###### v9 Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into despair. ###### v10 Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you. ###### v11 Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters. He who speaks against a fellow believer or judges a fellow believer speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge. ###### v12 But there is only one who is lawgiver and judge--the one who is able to save and destroy. On the other hand, who are you to judge your neighbor? ###### v13 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit." ###### v14 You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like? For you are a puff of smoke that appears for a short time and then vanishes. ###### v15 You ought to say instead, "If the Lord is willing, then we will live and do this or that." ###### v16 But as it is, you boast about your arrogant plans. All such boasting is evil. ###### v17 So whoever knows what is good to do and does not do it is guilty of sin.
