The Dispersion of the Nations at Babel ###### 1 The whole earth had a common language and a common vocabulary. ###### v2 When the people moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there. ###### v3 Then they said to one another, "Come, let's make bricks and bake them thoroughly." (They had brick instead of stone and tar instead of mortar.) ###### v4 Then they said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens so that we may make a name for ourselves. Otherwise we will be scattered across the face of the entire earth." ###### v5 But the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the people had started building. ###### v6 And the LORD said, "If as one people all sharing a common language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be beyond them. ###### v7 Come, let's go down and confuse their language so they won't be able to understand each other." ###### v8 So the LORD scattered them from there across the face of the entire earth, and they stopped building the city. ###### v9 That is why its name was called Babel--because there the LORD confused the language of the entire world, and from there the LORD scattered them across the face of the entire earth.The Genealogy of Shem ###### v10 This is the account of Shem.

The name of Abram's wife was Sarai. And the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah; she was the daughter of Haran, who was the father of both Milcah and Iscah. ###### v30 But Sarai was barren; she had no children. ###### v31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (the son of Haran), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and with them he set out from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to Canaan.
