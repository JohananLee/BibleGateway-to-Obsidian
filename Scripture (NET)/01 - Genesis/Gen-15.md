The Cutting of the Covenant ###### 1 After these things the LORD's message came to Abram in a vision: "Fear not, Abram! I am your shield and the one who will reward you in great abundance." ###### v2 But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, what will you give me since I continue to be childless, and my heir is Eliezer of Damascus?" ###### v3 Abram added, "Since you have not given me a descendant, then look, one born in my house will be my heir!" ###### v4 But look, the LORD's message came to him: "This man will not be your heir, but instead a son who comes from your own body will be your heir." ###### v5 The LORD took him outside and said, "Gaze into the sky and count the stars--if you are able to count them!" Then he said to him, "So will your descendants be." ###### v6 Abram believed the LORD, and the LORD credited it as righteousness to him. ###### v7 The LORD said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess." ###### v8 But Abram said, "O Sovereign LORD, by what can I know that I am to possess it?" ###### v9 The LORD said to him, "Take for me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a dove and a young pigeon." ###### v10 So Abram took all these for him and then cut them in two and placed each half opposite the other, but he did not cut the birds in half. ###### v11 When birds of prey came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away. ###### v12 When the sun went down, Abram fell sound asleep, and great terror overwhelmed him. ###### v13 Then the LORD said to Abram, "Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign country. They will be enslaved and oppressed for 400 years. ###### v14 But I will execute judgment on the nation that they will serve. Afterward they will come out with many possessions. ###### v15 But as for you, you will go to your ancestors in peace and be buried at a good old age. ###### v16 In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the sin of the Amorites has not yet reached its limit." ###### v17 When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking firepot with a flaming torch passed between the animal parts. ###### v18 That day the LORD made a covenant with Abram: "To your descendants I give this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates River-- ###### v19 the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, ###### v20 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, ###### v21 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites."
