Abraham and Abimelech ###### 1 Abraham journeyed from there to the Negev region and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he lived as a temporary resident in Gerar, ###### v2 Abraham said about his wife Sarah, "She is my sister." So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her. ###### v3 But God appeared to Abimelech in a dream at night and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is someone else's wife." ###### v4 Now Abimelech had not gone near her. He said, "Lord, would you really slaughter an innocent nation? ###### v5 Did Abraham not say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'He is my brother.' I have done this with a clear conscience and with innocent hands!" ###### v6 Then in the dream God replied to him, "Yes, I know that you have done this with a clear conscience. That is why I have kept you from sinning against me and why I did not allow you to touch her. ###### v7 But now give back the man's wife. Indeed he is a prophet and he will pray for you; thus you will live. But if you don't give her back, know that you will surely die along with all who belong to you." ###### v8 Early in the morning Abimelech summoned all his servants. When he told them about all these things, they were terrified. ###### v9 Abimelech summoned Abraham and said to him, "What have you done to us? What sin did I commit against you that would cause you to bring such great guilt on me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done!" ###### v10 Then Abimelech asked Abraham, "What prompted you to do this thing?" ###### v11 Abraham replied, "Because I thought, 'Surely no one fears God in this place. They will kill me because of my wife.' ###### v12 What's more, she is indeed my sister, my father's daughter, but not my mother's daughter. She became my wife. ###### v13 When God made me wander from my father's house, I told her, 'This is what you can do to show your loyalty to me: Every place we go, say about me, "He is my brother."'" ###### v14 So Abimelech gave sheep, cattle, and male and female servants to Abraham. He also gave his wife Sarah back to him. ###### v15 Then Abimelech said, "Look, my land is before you; live wherever you please." ###### v16 To Sarah he said, "Look, I have given 1,000 pieces of silver to your 'brother.' This is compensation for you so that you will stand vindicated before all who are with you." ###### v17 Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, as well as his wife and female slaves so that they were able to have children. ###### v18 For the LORD had caused infertility to strike every woman in the household of Abimelech because he took Sarah, Abraham's wife.
