Christian Unity and Christ's Humility ###### 1 Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort provided by love, any fellowship in the Spirit, any affection or mercy, ###### v2 complete my joy and be of the same mind, by having the same love, being united in spirit, and having one purpose. ###### v3 Instead of being motivated by selfish ambition or vanity, each of you should, in humility, be moved to treat one another as more important than yourself. ###### v4 Each of you should be concerned not only about your own interests, but about the interests of others as well. ###### v5 You should have the same attitude toward one another that Christ Jesus had, ###### v6 who though he existed in the form of God did not regard equality with God as something to be grasped, ###### v7 but emptied himself by taking on the form of a slave, by looking like other men, and by sharing in human nature. ###### v8 He humbled himself, by becoming obedient to the point of death --even death on a cross! ###### v9 As a result God highly exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, ###### v10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow --in heaven and on earth and under the earth-- ###### v11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father.Lights in the World ###### v12 So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, continue working out your salvation with awe and reverence, ###### v13 for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort--for the sake of his good pleasure--is God. ###### v14 Do everything without grumbling or arguing, ###### v15 so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society, in which you shine as lights in the world ###### v16 by holding on to the word of life so that on the day of Christ I will have a reason to boast that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain. ###### v17 But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice together with all of you. ###### v18 And in the same way you also should be glad and rejoice together with me.Models for Ministry ###### v19 Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be encouraged by hearing news about you. ###### v20 For there is no one here like him who will readily demonstrate his deep concern for you. ###### v21 Others are busy with their own concerns, not those of Jesus Christ. ###### v22 But you know his qualifications, that like a son working with his father, he served with me in advancing the gospel. ###### v23 So I hope to send him as soon as I know more about my situation, ###### v24 though I am confident in the Lord that I too will be coming to see you soon. ###### v25 But for now I have considered it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you. For he is my brother, coworker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to me in my need. ###### v26 Indeed, he greatly missed all of you and was distressed because you heard that he had been ill. ###### v27 In fact he became so ill that he nearly died. But God showed mercy to him--and not to him only, but also to me--so that I would not have grief on top of grief. ###### v28 Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you can rejoice and I can be free from anxiety. ###### v29 So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, ###### v30 since it was because of the work of Christ that he almost died. He risked his life so that he could make up for your inability to serve me.
